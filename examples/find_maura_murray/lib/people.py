Mike can also use this information to show that her arrival was several minutes before the police arrived. Faith doesn't totally trust

Official reports say Cecil Smith was the first officer to arrive on the scene of Maura's car. He was driving a 4x4 explorer and

When he arrived, he observed a black Saturn facing the wrong direction but no one was in or around the car. He saw there was
something red splashed on the window and the seat of the vehicle. It looked like wine. He approached Butch Atwood about what he saw
and he said Maura didn't appear hurt or intoxicated and that Maura told Butch he didn't need to call 911 and that she claimed she
already called AAA. He said he actually didn't talk to Butch for very long. He claims he talked to Maura's dad Fred. In that communication
Fred allegedly told Officer Smith flippantly that Maura might have just gotten depressed and 'done the old squaw', and that sometimes when you're depressed you just
go off into the woods, you step off, and you die. This response shocked the officer. In another conversation with Maura's sister Kathleen,
the sister told the officer that Maura probably got in a big fight with her boyfriend Fred, went off into the woods, took a bunch of sleeping
pills and died.
Later when EMS arrived, he joined Butch Atwood to search the area west around the accident. They don't find Maura or even foot prints.
Some of Maura's personal belongings were scattered inside, but her cell phone, credit cards, and backpack are all gone. Inside the card he finds an open 
coke bottle filled with a red liquid that smelled of alcohol.

Fred will agree with Cecil's account that Maura might have gone on a 'squaw walk' but says he just didn't know how to express himself and he

On a separate occasion when Maura wrecked his car, he claims he was upset but told her 'It's gonna be alright, it's not the worst thing in the world'
He 'knows' she wouldn't have committed suicide.

She got all As in school. She was really determined. As a kid, she was very attentive, keeping a sharp eye on Julie. Kathleen was less in

would go camping, hiking, swimming in the rivers, especially in Bartlett New Hampshire. He doesn't know why she went wherever she was going that
day but thinks about how close Bartlett was to where she disappeared, that maybe she was going there for some solace. He thinks someone
grabbed her and killed her. He wishes he could just have Maura to talk to her one last time. He wouldn't even have to say anything, neither of
them would.

but honestly, I didn't feel like talking too much of anyone, I promise to call today though. Love you, Maura" She also made a phone call inquiring about 
renting a condominium at the same Bartlett, New Hampshire, condo association with which her family had vacationed in the past. Telephone records indicate 
the call lasted three minutes. At 1:13 pm, Murray called a fellow nursing student for reasons unknown.
On the afternoon of Monday, February 9, at 1:24 pm, Murray emailed a work supervisor of the nursing school faculty that she would be out of town for a week due to a death in her family.
She sent a similar email to her professor at the University of Massachusettes at the same time and after sending in her homework early.
Murray used her personal computer to search MapQuest for directions to the Berkshires and Burlington, Vermont.
At 2:05 pm, Murray called a number which provides recorded information about booking hotels in Stowe, Vermont. The call lasted approximately five minutes. 
At 2:18 pm, she telephoned her boyfriend and left a voice message promising him they would talk later. This call ended after one minute.
At 3:15 PM, there is security camera footage of Maura visiting a local ATM withdrawing $280 which is nearly all of the money she has in the account.

    Billy will describe their relationship as "engaged to be engaged".
    Billy says he received a voicemail from Maura the day after Maura disappeared, Billy turned off his cellphone as he boarded a plane
    to assist in the search efforts. Shortly after he did, he received a voicemail from an unknown number. It was short and wordless. He says
    He could only hear crying and at the end a whimper. He swears this was Maura. Officials traced the number to an AT&T calling card. He remembers
    this well because Billy's mother Sharon gave Maura two AT&T calling cards a couple months earlier. Haverhill police claimed they traced the call
    back to the American Red cross. Yet Sharon says multiple private investigators had tried and failed to trace the call.

    Maura and Billy got into fights fairly frequently. When they did, Maura needed to be comforted and talked down afterwards.
    Julie and Maura were 2 and a half years apart. They spent their youth running track together always wanting to make their father proud.
    She describes her time at West Point is just being stressed every day. Talent doesn't matter in whether you'll make it through the first
    six months. Julie and Maura would gossip and talk a lot, especially about Billy. Julie describes Bill as a talker saying
    "he was a little much for me." Julie and Maura's last conversation was about spring break. Maura was excited about it and was talking
    about going to Myrtle beach. This was two days before her disappearance and she says there was nothing odd about her at the time. Maura
    mentioned nothing about the trip she took when she disappeared. Julie defends her father. She says all over the internet people misrepresent
    her dad. She thinks something bad happened. Maybe Maura's initial plan was to go up there for whatever reason no one knows, but something
    happened and derailed that plan. If she was able to reach out and let them know she was fine, she would have but didn't. Julie thinks the FBI should
    have been brought in from the beginning. There were changes to the police report, it took a long time for the reports to be published. The
