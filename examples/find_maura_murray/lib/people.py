go off into the woods, you step off, and you die. This response shocked the officer. In another conversation with Maura's sister Kathleen,
the sister told the officer that Maura probably got in a big fight with her boyfriend Fred, went off into the woods, took a bunch of sleeping
pills and died.

but honestly, I didn't feel like talking too much of anyone, I promise to call today though. Love you, Maura" She also made a phone call inquiring about 
renting a condominium at the same Bartlett, New Hampshire, condo association with which her family had vacationed in the past. Telephone records indicate 
the call lasted three minutes. At 1:13 pm, Murray called a fellow nursing student for reasons unknown.
On the afternoon of Monday, February 9, at 1:24 pm, Murray emailed a work supervisor of the nursing school faculty that she would be out of town for a week due to a death in her family.
She sent a similar email to her professor at the University of Massachusettes at the same time and after sending in her homework early.
Murray used her personal computer to search MapQuest for directions to the Berkshires and Burlington, Vermont.
At 2:05 pm, Murray called a number which provides recorded information about booking hotels in Stowe, Vermont. The call lasted approximately five minutes. 
At 2:18 pm, she telephoned her boyfriend and left a voice message promising him they would talk later. This call ended after one minute.
At 3:15 PM, there is security camera footage of Maura visiting a local ATM withdrawing $280 which is nearly all of the money she has in the account.
The footage shows she's alone when she arrives and leaves.
Shortly after, there is footage at a nearby liquor store where she purchases $40 of alcohol including Baileys Irish Cream, Kahl√∫a, vodka, and a box of Franzia wine. She also appears alone.
She called to check her voicemail at 4:37 pm, the last recorded use of her cell phone.
The data analyst will also point out there was considerable search history on Maura's computer related to pregnancy.

    Billy will describe their relationship as "engaged to be engaged".
    Billy says he received a voicemail from Maura the day after Maura disappeared, Billy turned off his cellphone as he boarded a plane
    to assist in the search efforts. Shortly after he did, he received a voicemail from an unknown number. It was short and wordless. He says
    He could only hear crying and at the end a whimper. He swears this was Maura. Officials traced the number to an AT&T calling card. He remembers
    this well because Billy's mother Sharon gave Maura two AT&T calling cards a couple months earlier. Haverhill police claimed they traced the call
    back to the American Red cross. Yet Sharon says multiple private investigators had tried and failed to trace the call.

    Maura and Billy got into fights fairly frequently. When they did, Maura needed to be comforted and talked down afterwards.
    Julie and Maura were 2 and a half years apart. They spent their youth running track together always wanting to make their father proud.
    She describes her time at West Point is just being stressed every day. Talent doesn't matter in whether you'll make it through the first
    six months. Julie and Maura would gossip and talk a lot, especially about Billy. Julie describes Bill as a talker saying
    "he was a little much for me." Julie and Maura's last conversation was about spring break. Maura was excited about it and was talking
    about going to Myrtle beach. This was two days before her disappearance and she says there was nothing odd about her at the time. Maura
    mentioned nothing about the trip she took when she disappeared. Julie defends her father. She says all over the internet people misrepresent
    her dad. She thinks something bad happened. Maybe Maura's initial plan was to go up there for whatever reason no one knows, but something
    happened and derailed that plan. If she was able to reach out and let them know she was fine, she would have but didn't. Julie thinks the FBI should
    have been brought in from the beginning. There were changes to the police report, it took a long time for the reports to be published. The
    police has never reached out to Julie to this day. She says if they had reached out to her sooner, maybe there was something she could have remembered.

    Kathleen is reluctant to share this information and will kind of avoid talking about it but eventually stumbles around to saying it.
    She will also talk about how she went camping with the family. She'll call them the good days, calling Maura the trailblazer.
    It was very rare that you would see her sad. When Kathleen is asked about the last time she heard from Maura she will get very tense.
    According to Kathleen, The last time she saw Maura, they all had a sit down dinner. Everyone was laughing and it was perfect.
    She'll say she lay awake at night with her mind going and going, not having the answers and that's killing them. She'll say her dad
    Fred needs closure. She cries when she says this. Maura didn't talk to Kathleen about the theft at Westpoint. The family wanted
    to keep it hush hush. She will say Westpoint was too tough for Maura. If any of it was talked about, it wasn't around Kathleen.
    Kathleen will say Maura would always come to her and it's such a mystery why this happened. She'll say maybe this was because Maura
    crashed Fred's car the night before and that's the only thing she could think of that would have upset her. She'll say that Maura's
    relationship with Bill was a rocky relationship that Maura had love for Bill but not trust. When they were sitting together at a
    restaurant Bill would be flirting with waitresses and Maura didn't like that. She'll guess that maybe Maura and Bill broke up, and 
    they seemed kind of distant. Maybe when someone asks her why Maura was witnessed saying
    'my sister' in a distressed state the night before her disappearance, she'll finally open up. At first she'll say it was an everyday
    phone call, but then she'll say she wasn't happy. Kathleen and her ex would get along when they'd both drink. She was self-medicating
    but it was making it worse. She sought help from a rehab. When her ex picked her up from rehab, they immediately went to a liquor store
    and it was right before, really close to when she went missing. She started drinking and took sleep medication after getting out of 
    rehab and told Maura that.  Kathleen will say Maura never mentioned anything about pregnancy and if Maura did mention that, 
    Kathleen would have been supportive. Kathleen says the family loves her so much and she doesn't deserve any harm. She thinks what
