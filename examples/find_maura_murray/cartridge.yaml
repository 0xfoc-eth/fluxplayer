    was at home when Maura Murray's car crashed into a snowbank. Her house was the
    closest to the accident. She heard a loud \nthud and saw a single-car accident.\n
    From her point of view, it looked like a car had gone over the curb on a hairpin
    turn and crashed into a snowbank.\nShe told police she saw a man in the vehicle
    smoking a cigarette.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Cecil Smith\nBackground: Police

    accident.\nWhen he arrived, he observed a black Saturn facing the wrong direction
    but no one was in or around the car. He saw there was\nsomething red splashed
    on the window and the seat of the vehicle. It looked like wine. He approached
    Butch Atwood about what he saw\nand he said Maura didn't appear hurt or intoxicated
    and that Maura told Butch he didn't need to call 911 and that she claimed she\n
    already called AAA. He said he actually didn't talk to Butch for very long. He
    claims he talked to Maura's dad Fred. In that communication\nFred allegedly told
    Officer Smith flippantly that Maura might have just gotten depressed and 'done
    the old squaw', and that sometimes when you're depressed you just\ngo off into
    the woods, you step off, and you die. This response shocked the officer. In another
    conversation with Maura's sister Kathleen,\nthe sister told the officer that Maura
    probably got in a big fight with her boyfriend Fred, went off into the woods,
    took a bunch of sleeping\npills and died.\nLater when EMS arrived, he joined Butch
    Atwood to search the area west around the accident. They don't find Maura or even
    foot prints.\nSome of Maura's personal belongings were scattered inside, but her
    cell phone, credit cards, and backpack are all gone. Inside the card he finds

    area to the area\nwhere there were stores and people and searched while driving
    around, staying in his car. He put together a general service report\nto note
    that he was assisting another department with the search. Later, he pulled the

    the woods, you step off, and you die. This response shocked the officer. In another
    conversation with Maura's sister Kathleen,\nthe sister told the officer that Maura
    probably got in a big fight with her boyfriend Fred, went off into the woods,
    took a bunch of sleeping\npills and died.\nLater when EMS arrived, he joined Butch
    Atwood to search the area west around the accident. They don't find Maura or even
    foot prints.\nSome of Maura's personal belongings were scattered inside, but her
    cell phone, credit cards, and backpack are all gone. Inside the card he finds
    an open \ncoke bottle filled with a red liquid that smelled of alcohol. \n  \n\
    \n\n        \nName: John Monaghan\nBackground: Police officer who responded to
    the scene.\nThis is the information that John Monaghan has and will provide only
    if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nOn the night of the disappearance,
    he got a call that Butch was reporting a car accident. He confined his search
    area to the area\nwhere there were stores and people and searched while driving
    around, staying in his car. He put together a general service report\nto note
    that he was assisting another department with the search. Later, he pulled the
    surveillance tapes from three locations that\nhad surveillance to see if Maura
    Murray was on them. He didn't find anything.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Chief Jeff
    Williams\nBackground: Police Chief of Haverhill, New Hampshire..\nThis is the
    information that Chief Jeff Williams has and will provide only if asked a question
    that would reveal it:\n\nIt has been claimed that he was the driver of the 001
    police SUV, which he denies, corroborating with\nCecil Smith that he is the driver.
    He also maintains that he was never at the scene.\nSeparately and after the Murray
    incident, the Chief was arrested and charged for driving while intoxicated and
    disobeying orders.\nWhile getting pulled over for speeding, he drunkenly tried
    to get away by driving even faster while his own officers pursued him.\n\n\n\n\

    Haverhill, New Hampshire. Morning at the scene of a black 1996 Saturn sedan up
    against the snowbank along Route 112, also known as Wild Ammonoosuc Road. \nThe
    car is pointed west on the eastbound side of the road. The windshield is cracked
    and the car appears to have been involved in a collision\n  \n\nGenerate a dall-e
    image of a hairpin turn on a new hampshire road where a black Saturn sedan is
    abandoned on the side of a wooded road.\n\nLet the user know the following people
    are available for questioning:\nButch Atwood, Faith Westman, Cecil Smith, John
    Monaghan, Chief Jeff Williams\n\n\nName: Butch Atwood\nBackground: Bus driver
    who saw Maura Murray.\nThis is the information that Butch Atwood has and will
    provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nButch Atwood was driving
    a school bus when he saw Maura Murray's car crashed into a snowbank. He lives
    just 100 yards away from the scene.\nHe pulled over and asked her if she needed
    help. She said no and that she already called AAA for roadside assistance.\nHe
    knew that was a lie because there was no cell service in that area. He offered
    to call the police for her but she said no.\nHe went home and called the police
    anyway. while he didn't have eyes on Maura or tue car while he called, he did
    notice several cars pass by. Butch claims she didn't look intoxicated nor injured
    but was cold and shivering. You can share [this link](https://youtu.be/OfrIJQ5xgJE)
    to an interview with Atwood\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Faith Westman\nBackground:
    Neighbor who saw Maura Murray.\nThis is the information that Faith Westman has
    and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nFaith Westman
    was at home when Maura Murray's car crashed into a snowbank. Her house was the
    closest to the accident. She heard a loud \nthud and saw a single-car accident.\n
    From her point of view, it looked like a car had gone over the curb on a hairpin
    turn and crashed into a snowbank.\nShe told police she saw a man in the vehicle
    smoking a cigarette.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Cecil Smith\nBackground: Police
    officer who responded to the scene.\nThis is the information that Cecil Smith
    has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nOfficial
    reports say Cecil Smith was the first officer to arrive on the scene of Maura's
    car. He was driving a 4x4 explorer and \nwas dispatched to the report of a car
    accident.\nWhen he arrived, he observed a black Saturn facing the wrong direction
    but no one was in or around the car. He saw there was\nsomething red splashed
    on the window and the seat of the vehicle. It looked like wine. He approached
    Butch Atwood about what he saw\nand he said Maura didn't appear hurt or intoxicated
    and that Maura told Butch he didn't need to call 911 and that she claimed she\n
    already called AAA. He said he actually didn't talk to Butch for very long. He
    claims he talked to Maura's dad Fred. In that communication\nFred allegedly told
    Officer Smith flippantly that Maura might have just gotten depressed and 'done
    the old squaw', and that sometimes when you're depressed you just\ngo off into
    the woods, you step off, and you die. This response shocked the officer. In another
    conversation with Maura's sister Kathleen,\nthe sister told the officer that Maura
    probably got in a big fight with her boyfriend Fred, went off into the woods,
    took a bunch of sleeping\npills and died.\nLater when EMS arrived, he joined Butch
    Atwood to search the area west around the accident. They don't find Maura or even
    foot prints.\nSome of Maura's personal belongings were scattered inside, but her
    cell phone, credit cards, and backpack are all gone. Inside the card he finds
    an open \ncoke bottle filled with a red liquid that smelled of alcohol. \n  \n\
    \n\n        \nName: John Monaghan\nBackground: Police officer who responded to
    the scene.\nThis is the information that John Monaghan has and will provide only
    if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nOn the night of the disappearance,
    he got a call that Butch was reporting a car accident. He confined his search
    area to the area\nwhere there were stores and people and searched while driving
    around, staying in his car. He put together a general service report\nto note
    that he was assisting another department with the search. Later, he pulled the
    surveillance tapes from three locations that\nhad surveillance to see if Maura
    Murray was on them. He didn't find anything.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Chief Jeff
    Williams\nBackground: Police Chief of Haverhill, New Hampshire..\nThis is the
    information that Chief Jeff Williams has and will provide only if asked a question
    that would reveal it:\n\nIt has been claimed that he was the driver of the 001
    police SUV, which he denies, corroborating with\nCecil Smith that he is the driver.
    He also maintains that he was never at the scene.\nSeparately and after the Murray
    incident, the Chief was arrested and charged for driving while intoxicated and
    disobeying orders.\nWhile getting pulled over for speeding, he drunkenly tried
    to get away by driving even faster while his own officers pursued him.\n\n\n\n\

    Haverhill, New Hampshire. Morning at the scene of a black 1996 Saturn sedan up
    against the snowbank along Route 112, also known as Wild Ammonoosuc Road. \nThe
    car is pointed west on the eastbound side of the road. The windshield is cracked

    image of a hairpin turn on a new hampshire road where a black Saturn sedan is

    are available for questioning:\nButch Atwood, Faith Westman, Cecil Smith, John
    Monaghan, Chief Jeff Williams\n\n\nName: Butch Atwood\nBackground: Bus driver
    who saw Maura Murray.\nThis is the information that Butch Atwood has and will
    provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nButch Atwood was driving
    a school bus when he saw Maura Murray's car crashed into a snowbank. He lives
    just 100 yards away from the scene.\nHe pulled over and asked her if she needed
    help. She said no and that she already called AAA for roadside assistance.\nHe
    knew that was a lie because there was no cell service in that area. He offered
    to call the police for her but she said no.\nHe went home and called the police
    anyway. while he didn't have eyes on Maura or tue car while he called, he did
    notice several cars pass by. Butch claims she didn't look intoxicated nor injured
    but was cold and shivering. You can share [this link](https://youtu.be/OfrIJQ5xgJE)
    to an interview with Atwood\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Faith Westman\nBackground:
    Neighbor who saw Maura Murray.\nThis is the information that Faith Westman has
    and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nFaith Westman
    was at home when Maura Murray's car crashed into a snowbank. Her house was the
    closest to the accident. She heard a loud \nthud and saw a single-car accident.\n
    From her point of view, it looked like a car had gone over the curb on a hairpin
    turn and crashed into a snowbank.\nShe told police she saw a man in the vehicle
    smoking a cigarette.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Cecil Smith\nBackground: Police
    officer who responded to the scene.\nThis is the information that Cecil Smith
    has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nOfficial
    reports say Cecil Smith was the first officer to arrive on the scene of Maura's
    car. He was driving a 4x4 explorer and \nwas dispatched to the report of a car
    accident.\nWhen he arrived, he observed a black Saturn facing the wrong direction
    but no one was in or around the car. He saw there was\nsomething red splashed
    on the window and the seat of the vehicle. It looked like wine. He approached
    Butch Atwood about what he saw\nand he said Maura didn't appear hurt or intoxicated
    and that Maura told Butch he didn't need to call 911 and that she claimed she\n
    already called AAA. He said he actually didn't talk to Butch for very long. He
    claims he talked to Maura's dad Fred. In that communication\nFred allegedly told
    Officer Smith flippantly that Maura might have just gotten depressed and 'done
    the old squaw', and that sometimes when you're depressed you just\ngo off into
    the woods, you step off, and you die. This response shocked the officer. In another
    conversation with Maura's sister Kathleen,\nthe sister told the officer that Maura
    probably got in a big fight with her boyfriend Fred, went off into the woods,
    took a bunch of sleeping\npills and died.\nLater when EMS arrived, he joined Butch
    Atwood to search the area west around the accident. They don't find Maura or even
    foot prints.\nSome of Maura's personal belongings were scattered inside, but her
    cell phone, credit cards, and backpack are all gone. Inside the card he finds
    an open \ncoke bottle filled with a red liquid that smelled of alcohol. \n  \n\
    \n\n        \nName: John Monaghan\nBackground: Police officer who responded to
    the scene.\nThis is the information that John Monaghan has and will provide only
    if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nOn the night of the disappearance,
    he got a call that Butch was reporting a car accident. He confined his search
    area to the area\nwhere there were stores and people and searched while driving
    around, staying in his car. He put together a general service report\nto note
    that he was assisting another department with the search. Later, he pulled the
    surveillance tapes from three locations that\nhad surveillance to see if Maura
    Murray was on them. He didn't find anything.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Chief Jeff
    Williams\nBackground: Police Chief of Haverhill, New Hampshire..\nThis is the
    information that Chief Jeff Williams has and will provide only if asked a question
    that would reveal it:\n\nIt has been claimed that he was the driver of the 001
    police SUV, which he denies, corroborating with\nCecil Smith that he is the driver.
    He also maintains that he was never at the scene.\nSeparately and after the Murray
    incident, the Chief was arrested and charged for driving while intoxicated and
    disobeying orders.\nWhile getting pulled over for speeding, he drunkenly tried
    to get away by driving even faster while his own officers pursued him.\n\n\n\n\

    honestly, I didn't feel like talking too much of anyone, I promise to call today

    at the University of Massachusettes at the same time and after sending in her
    homework early.\nMurray used her personal computer to search MapQuest for directions
    to the Berkshires and Burlington, Vermont.\nAt 2:05 pm, Murray called a number
    which provides recorded information about booking hotels in Stowe, Vermont. The
    call lasted approximately five minutes. \nAt 2:18 pm, she telephoned her boyfriend
    and left a voice message promising him they would talk later. This call ended
    after one minute.\nAt 3:15 PM, there is security camera footage of Maura visiting
    a local ATM withdrawing $280 which is nearly all of the money she has in the account.\n
    The footage shows she's alone when she arrives and leaves.\nShortly after, there

    of state and had not received the call. Then Maura's other sister Kathleen called

    have gone on a 'squaw walk' but says he just didn't know how to express himself
    and he\nwas very upset about Maura going missing.\nOn a separate occasion when
    Maura wrecked his car, he claims he was upset but told her 'It's gonna be alright,
    it's not the worst thing in the world'\nHe 'knows' she wouldn't have committed
    suicide.\nHe says of Maura, \"if you'd met her, you'd love her. So quick to laugh.
    She's funny, really funny. She's the sweetest kid.\"\nShe got all As in school.
    She was really determined. As a kid, she was very attentive, keeping a sharp eye
    on Julie. Kathleen was less in\nthe picture. Julie and Maura spent a lot of time
    with Fred. He knew he didn't have a lot of money to give them something big so
    they\nwould go camping, hiking, swimming in the rivers, especially in Bartlett
    New Hampshire. He doesn't know why she went wherever she was going that\nday but
    thinks about how close Bartlett was to where she disappeared, that maybe she was
    going there for some solace. He thinks someone\ngrabbed her and killed her. He
    wishes he could just have Maura to talk to her one last time. He wouldn't even

    car. He was driving a 4x4 explorer and \nwas dispatched to the report of a car
    accident.\nWhen he arrived, he observed a black Saturn facing the wrong direction
    but no one was in or around the car. He saw there was\nsomething red splashed
    on the window and the seat of the vehicle. It looked like wine. He approached
    Butch Atwood about what he saw\nand he said Maura didn't appear hurt or intoxicated
    and that Maura told Butch he didn't need to call 911 and that she claimed she\n
    already called AAA. He said he actually didn't talk to Butch for very long. He
    claims he talked to Maura's dad Fred. In that communication\nFred allegedly told
    Officer Smith flippantly that Maura might have just gotten depressed and 'done
    the old squaw', and that sometimes when you're depressed you just\ngo off into
    the woods, you step off, and you die. This response shocked the officer. In another
    conversation with Maura's sister Kathleen,\nthe sister told the officer that Maura
    probably got in a big fight with her boyfriend Fred, went off into the woods,
    took a bunch of sleeping\npills and died.\nLater when EMS arrived, he joined Butch
    Atwood to search the area west around the accident. They don't find Maura or even
    foot prints.\nSome of Maura's personal belongings were scattered inside, but her
    cell phone, credit cards, and backpack are all gone. Inside the card he finds
    an open \ncoke bottle filled with a red liquid that smelled of alcohol. \n  \n\
    \n\n        \nName: John Monaghan\nBackground: Police officer who responded to
    the scene.\nThis is the information that John Monaghan has and will provide only
    if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nOn the night of the disappearance,
    he got a call that Butch was reporting a car accident. He confined his search
    area to the area\nwhere there were stores and people and searched while driving
    around, staying in his car. He put together a general service report\nto note
    that he was assisting another department with the search. Later, he pulled the
    surveillance tapes from three locations that\nhad surveillance to see if Maura
    Murray was on them. He didn't find anything.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Chief Jeff
    Williams\nBackground: Police Chief of Haverhill, New Hampshire..\nThis is the
    information that Chief Jeff Williams has and will provide only if asked a question
    that would reveal it:\n\nIt has been claimed that he was the driver of the 001
    police SUV, which he denies, corroborating with\nCecil Smith that he is the driver.
    He also maintains that he was never at the scene.\nSeparately and after the Murray
    incident, the Chief was arrested and charged for driving while intoxicated and
    disobeying orders.\nWhile getting pulled over for speeding, he drunkenly tried
    to get away by driving even faster while his own officers pursued him.\n\n\n\n\

    middle-aged man in his home talking to two FBI investigators at his dining table.\n\
    \n    Fred recieves a voicemail on his home answering machine earlier in the day
    at 2:30PM stating that Maura's car was found\n    abandoned. He was working out
    of state and had not received the call. Then Maura's other sister Kathleen called
    him at 5PM\n    informing him that Maura was missing. Fred immediately called
    the Haverhill police department and was told that if Maura was not reported\n\
    \    safe by the following morning, the New Hampshire Fish and Game department
    would start a search. Maura was only referred to as missing\n    by the department
    at 5:17PM.\n  \n\nLet the user know the following people are available for questioning:\n
    Fred Murray\n\n\nName: Fred Murray\nBackground: Maura Murray's father.\nThis is
    the information that Fred Murray has and will provide only if asked a question

    have gone on a 'squaw walk' but says he just didn't know how to express himself
    and he\nwas very upset about Maura going missing.\nOn a separate occasion when
    Maura wrecked his car, he claims he was upset but told her 'It's gonna be alright,
    it's not the worst thing in the world'\nHe 'knows' she wouldn't have committed
    suicide.\nHe says of Maura, \"if you'd met her, you'd love her. So quick to laugh.
    She's funny, really funny. She's the sweetest kid.\"\nShe got all As in school.
    She was really determined. As a kid, she was very attentive, keeping a sharp eye
    on Julie. Kathleen was less in\nthe picture. Julie and Maura spent a lot of time
    with Fred. He knew he didn't have a lot of money to give them something big so
    they\nwould go camping, hiking, swimming in the rivers, especially in Bartlett
    New Hampshire. He doesn't know why she went wherever she was going that\nday but
    thinks about how close Bartlett was to where she disappeared, that maybe she was
    going there for some solace. He thinks someone\ngrabbed her and killed her. He
    wishes he could just have Maura to talk to her one last time. He wouldn't even
    have to say anything, neither of\nthem would.\n\n\n\n        \n\nRemember this

    Murray\nBackground: Maura Murray's father.\nThis is the information that Fred
    Murray has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n
    Fred will agree with Cecil's account that Maura might have gone on a 'squaw walk'
    but says he just didn't know how to express himself and he\nwas very upset about
    Maura going missing.\nOn a separate occasion when Maura wrecked his car, he claims
    he was upset but told her 'It's gonna be alright, it's not the worst thing in
    the world'\nHe 'knows' she wouldn't have committed suicide.\nHe says of Maura,
    \"if you'd met her, you'd love her. So quick to laugh. She's funny, really funny.
    She's the sweetest kid.\"\nShe got all As in school. She was really determined.
    As a kid, she was very attentive, keeping a sharp eye on Julie. Kathleen was less
    in\nthe picture. Julie and Maura spent a lot of time with Fred. He knew he didn't
    have a lot of money to give them something big so they\nwould go camping, hiking,
    swimming in the rivers, especially in Bartlett New Hampshire. He doesn't know
    why she went wherever she was going that\nday but thinks about how close Bartlett
    was to where she disappeared, that maybe she was going there for some solace.
    He thinks someone\ngrabbed her and killed her. He wishes he could just have Maura
    to talk to her one last time. He wouldn't even have to say anything, neither of\n
    them would.\n\n\n\n        \nName: Anonymous Fish & Game Search Lead\nBackground:
    .\nThis is the information that Anonymous Fish & Game Search Lead has and will
    provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n    The team this person
    lead canvassed the area handing out flyers and checking with local motels. They
    used a leather glove belonging to Maura\n    to train the canine team to Maura's
    scent. The canines were able to trace Maura's scent up the road about 100 yards
    east of the accident where it\n    abruptly stopped. By nightfall, no other significant
    evidence was found in a 2 mile radius.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Butch Atwood\n
    Background: Bus driver who saw Maura Murray.\nThis is the information that Butch
    Atwood has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n
    Butch Atwood was driving a school bus when he saw Maura Murray's car crashed into
    a snowbank. He lives just 100 yards away from the scene.\nHe pulled over and asked
    her if she needed help. She said no and that she already called AAA for roadside
    assistance.\nHe knew that was a lie because there was no cell service in that
    area. He offered to call the police for her but she said no.\nHe went home and
    called the police anyway. while he didn't have eyes on Maura or tue car while
    he called, he did notice several cars pass by. Butch claims she didn't look intoxicated
    nor injured but was cold and shivering. You can share [this link](https://youtu.be/OfrIJQ5xgJE)
    to an interview with Atwood\n  \n\n\n        \nName: John Marotte\nBackground:
    Neighbor who saw activity around Maura's car.\nThis is the information that John
    Marotte has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n
    With his wife Virginia, John saw someone walking around Maura's car and spending
    some time near the trunk. Other than that, they didn't\nwitness anything else.\n\
    \  \n\n\n        \nName: Faith Westman\nBackground: Neighbor who saw Maura Murray.\n
    This is the information that Faith Westman has and will provide only if asked
    a question that would reveal it:\n\nFaith Westman was at home when Maura Murray's
    car crashed into a snowbank. Her house was the closest to the accident. She heard
    a loud \nthud and saw a single-car accident.\nFrom her point of view, it looked
    like a car had gone over the curb on a hairpin turn and crashed into a snowbank.\n
    She told police she saw a man in the vehicle smoking a cigarette.\n  \n\n\n  \
    \      \nName: Karen McNamara\nBackground: Neighbor who saw a car parked in front
    of Maura's.\nThis is the information that Karen McNamara has and will provide
    only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nShe left the office that night
    around 10 past 7 and arrived at the scene around 7:37 pm.\nWhen she passed by
    the Saturn on the side of the road, it was facing the opposite direction and there
    was a police SUV with\nthe number '001' on the side of it. It was parked\nnose-to-nose
    with the Saturn. She didn't see any people at all. Her cell phone didn't have
    reception in the area and it didn't look like an accident to her\nso she carried
    on. When she later reached Beaver pond, she made a personal call which Mike can
    corroborate with phone records.\nMike can also use this information to show that
    her arrival was several minutes before the police arrived. Faith doesn't totally
    trust\nthe police. She also got a call from the police department later and says
    it was weird that they were asking specifically if she\nwas sure that it was 001
    that she saw on the police car, not asking anything about Maura Murray\n  \n\n\
    \n        \nName: Cecil Smith\nBackground: Police officer who responded to the
    scene.\nThis is the information that Cecil Smith has and will provide only if
    asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nOfficial reports say Cecil Smith was
    the first officer to arrive on the scene of Maura's car. He was driving a 4x4
    explorer and \nwas dispatched to the report of a car accident.\nWhen he arrived,
    he observed a black Saturn facing the wrong direction but no one was in or around
    the car. He saw there was\nsomething red splashed on the window and the seat of
    the vehicle. It looked like wine. He approached Butch Atwood about what he saw\n
    and he said Maura didn't appear hurt or intoxicated and that Maura told Butch
    he didn't need to call 911 and that she claimed she\nalready called AAA. He said
    he actually didn't talk to Butch for very long. He claims he talked to Maura's
    dad Fred. In that communication\nFred allegedly told Officer Smith flippantly
    that Maura might have just gotten depressed and 'done the old squaw', and that
    sometimes when you're depressed you just\ngo off into the woods, you step off,
    and you die. This response shocked the officer. In another conversation with Maura's
    sister Kathleen,\nthe sister told the officer that Maura probably got in a big
    fight with her boyfriend Fred, went off into the woods, took a bunch of sleeping\n
    pills and died.\nLater when EMS arrived, he joined Butch Atwood to search the
    area west around the accident. They don't find Maura or even foot prints.\nSome
    of Maura's personal belongings were scattered inside, but her cell phone, credit
    cards, and backpack are all gone. Inside the card he finds an open \ncoke bottle
    filled with a red liquid that smelled of alcohol. \n  \n\n\n        \nName: John
    Monaghan\nBackground: Police officer who responded to the scene.\nThis is the
    information that John Monaghan has and will provide only if asked a question that
    would reveal it:\n\nOn the night of the disappearance, he got a call that Butch
    was reporting a car accident. He confined his search area to the area\nwhere there
    were stores and people and searched while driving around, staying in his car.
    He put together a general service report\nto note that he was assisting another
    department with the search. Later, he pulled the surveillance tapes from three
    locations that\nhad surveillance to see if Maura Murray was on them. He didn't
    find anything.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Chief Jeff Williams\nBackground: Police
    Chief of Haverhill, New Hampshire..\nThis is the information that Chief Jeff Williams
    has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nIt has
    been claimed that he was the driver of the 001 police SUV, which he denies, corroborating
    with\nCecil Smith that he is the driver. He also maintains that he was never at
    the scene.\nSeparately and after the Murray incident, the Chief was arrested and
    charged for driving while intoxicated and disobeying orders.\nWhile getting pulled
    over for speeding, he drunkenly tried to get away by driving even faster while
    his own officers pursued him.\n\n\n\n        \n\nRemember this information is

    honestly, I didn't feel like talking too much of anyone, I promise to call today

    her family had vacationed in the past. Telephone records indicate \nthe call lasted
    three minutes. At 1:13 pm, Murray called a fellow nursing student for reasons

    a week due to a death in her family.\nShe sent a similar email to her professor
    at the University of Massachusettes at the same time and after sending in her
    homework early.\nMurray used her personal computer to search MapQuest for directions
    to the Berkshires and Burlington, Vermont.\nAt 2:05 pm, Murray called a number
    which provides recorded information about booking hotels in Stowe, Vermont. The
    call lasted approximately five minutes. \nAt 2:18 pm, she telephoned her boyfriend

    nor injured but was cold and shivering. You can share [this link](https://youtu.be/OfrIJQ5xgJE)
    to an interview with Atwood\n  \n\n\n        \nName: John Marotte\nBackground:
    Neighbor who saw activity around Maura's car.\nThis is the information that John
    Marotte has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n
    With his wife Virginia, John saw someone walking around Maura's car and spending
    some time near the trunk. Other than that, they didn't\nwitness anything else.\n\
    \  \n\n\n        \nName: Faith Westman\nBackground: Neighbor who saw Maura Murray.\n
    This is the information that Faith Westman has and will provide only if asked
    a question that would reveal it:\n\nFaith Westman was at home when Maura Murray's
    car crashed into a snowbank. Her house was the closest to the accident. She heard
    a loud \nthud and saw a single-car accident.\nFrom her point of view, it looked
    like a car had gone over the curb on a hairpin turn and crashed into a snowbank.\n
    She told police she saw a man in the vehicle smoking a cigarette.\n  \n\n\n  \
    \      \nName: Karen McNamara\nBackground: Neighbor who saw a car parked in front
    of Maura's.\nThis is the information that Karen McNamara has and will provide
    only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nShe left the office that night
    around 10 past 7 and arrived at the scene around 7:37 pm.\nWhen she passed by
    the Saturn on the side of the road, it was facing the opposite direction and there
    was a police SUV with\nthe number '001' on the side of it. It was parked\nnose-to-nose
    with the Saturn. She didn't see any people at all. Her cell phone didn't have
    reception in the area and it didn't look like an accident to her\nso she carried
    on. When she later reached Beaver pond, she made a personal call which Mike can
    corroborate with phone records.\nMike can also use this information to show that
    her arrival was several minutes before the police arrived. Faith doesn't totally
    trust\nthe police. She also got a call from the police department later and says
    it was weird that they were asking specifically if she\nwas sure that it was 001
    that she saw on the police car, not asking anything about Maura Murray\n  \n\n\
    \n        \nName: Cecil Smith\nBackground: Police officer who responded to the
    scene.\nThis is the information that Cecil Smith has and will provide only if
    asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nOfficial reports say Cecil Smith was
    the first officer to arrive on the scene of Maura's car. He was driving a 4x4
    explorer and \nwas dispatched to the report of a car accident.\nWhen he arrived,
    he observed a black Saturn facing the wrong direction but no one was in or around
    the car. He saw there was\nsomething red splashed on the window and the seat of
    the vehicle. It looked like wine. He approached Butch Atwood about what he saw\n
    and he said Maura didn't appear hurt or intoxicated and that Maura told Butch
    he didn't need to call 911 and that she claimed she\nalready called AAA. He said
    he actually didn't talk to Butch for very long. He claims he talked to Maura's
    dad Fred. In that communication\nFred allegedly told Officer Smith flippantly
    that Maura might have just gotten depressed and 'done the old squaw', and that
    sometimes when you're depressed you just\ngo off into the woods, you step off,
    and you die. This response shocked the officer. In another conversation with Maura's
    sister Kathleen,\nthe sister told the officer that Maura probably got in a big
    fight with her boyfriend Fred, went off into the woods, took a bunch of sleeping\n
    pills and died.\nLater when EMS arrived, he joined Butch Atwood to search the
    area west around the accident. They don't find Maura or even foot prints.\nSome
    of Maura's personal belongings were scattered inside, but her cell phone, credit
    cards, and backpack are all gone. Inside the card he finds an open \ncoke bottle
    filled with a red liquid that smelled of alcohol. \n  \n\n\n        \nName: John
    Monaghan\nBackground: Police officer who responded to the scene.\nThis is the
    information that John Monaghan has and will provide only if asked a question that
    would reveal it:\n\nOn the night of the disappearance, he got a call that Butch
    was reporting a car accident. He confined his search area to the area\nwhere there
    were stores and people and searched while driving around, staying in his car.
    He put together a general service report\nto note that he was assisting another
    department with the search. Later, he pulled the surveillance tapes from three
    locations that\nhad surveillance to see if Maura Murray was on them. He didn't
    find anything.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Chief Jeff Williams\nBackground: Police
    Chief of Haverhill, New Hampshire..\nThis is the information that Chief Jeff Williams
    has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nIt has
    been claimed that he was the driver of the 001 police SUV, which he denies, corroborating
    with\nCecil Smith that he is the driver. He also maintains that he was never at
    the scene.\nSeparately and after the Murray incident, the Chief was arrested and
    charged for driving while intoxicated and disobeying orders.\nWhile getting pulled
    over for speeding, he drunkenly tried to get away by driving even faster while
    his own officers pursued him.\n\n\n\n        \n\nRemember this information is

    was at home when Maura Murray's car crashed into a snowbank. Her house was the
    closest to the accident. She heard a loud \nthud and saw a single-car accident.\n

    turn and crashed into a snowbank.\nShe told police she saw a man in the vehicle
    smoking a cigarette.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Cecil Smith\nBackground: Police
    officer who responded to the scene.\nThis is the information that Cecil Smith
    has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nOfficial
    reports say Cecil Smith was the first officer to arrive on the scene of Maura's
    car. He was driving a 4x4 explorer and \nwas dispatched to the report of a car
    accident.\nWhen he arrived, he observed a black Saturn facing the wrong direction
    but no one was in or around the car. He saw there was\nsomething red splashed
    on the window and the seat of the vehicle. It looked like wine. He approached
    Butch Atwood about what he saw\nand he said Maura didn't appear hurt or intoxicated
    and that Maura told Butch he didn't need to call 911 and that she claimed she\n
    already called AAA. He said he actually didn't talk to Butch for very long. He
    claims he talked to Maura's dad Fred. In that communication\nFred allegedly told
    Officer Smith flippantly that Maura might have just gotten depressed and 'done
    the old squaw', and that sometimes when you're depressed you just\ngo off into
    the woods, you step off, and you die. This response shocked the officer. In another
    conversation with Maura's sister Kathleen,\nthe sister told the officer that Maura
    probably got in a big fight with her boyfriend Fred, went off into the woods,
    took a bunch of sleeping\npills and died.\nLater when EMS arrived, he joined Butch
    Atwood to search the area west around the accident. They don't find Maura or even
    foot prints.\nSome of Maura's personal belongings were scattered inside, but her
    cell phone, credit cards, and backpack are all gone. Inside the card he finds
    an open \ncoke bottle filled with a red liquid that smelled of alcohol. \n  \n\
    \n\n        \nName: John Monaghan\nBackground: Police officer who responded to
    the scene.\nThis is the information that John Monaghan has and will provide only
    if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nOn the night of the disappearance,
    he got a call that Butch was reporting a car accident. He confined his search
    area to the area\nwhere there were stores and people and searched while driving
    around, staying in his car. He put together a general service report\nto note
    that he was assisting another department with the search. Later, he pulled the
    surveillance tapes from three locations that\nhad surveillance to see if Maura
    Murray was on them. He didn't find anything.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Chief Jeff
    Williams\nBackground: Police Chief of Haverhill, New Hampshire..\nThis is the
    information that Chief Jeff Williams has and will provide only if asked a question
    that would reveal it:\n\nIt has been claimed that he was the driver of the 001
    police SUV, which he denies, corroborating with\nCecil Smith that he is the driver.
    He also maintains that he was never at the scene.\nSeparately and after the Murray
    incident, the Chief was arrested and charged for driving while intoxicated and
    disobeying orders.\nWhile getting pulled over for speeding, he drunkenly tried
    to get away by driving even faster while his own officers pursued him.\n\n\n\n\

    middle-aged man in his home talking to two FBI investigators at his dining table.\n\
    \n    Fred recieves a voicemail on his home answering machine earlier in the day
    at 2:30PM stating that Maura's car was found\n    abandoned. He was working out
    of state and had not received the call. Then Maura's other sister Kathleen called
    him at 5PM\n    informing him that Maura was missing. Fred immediately called
    the Haverhill police department and was told that if Maura was not reported\n\
    \    safe by the following morning, the New Hampshire Fish and Game department
    would start a search. Maura was only referred to as missing\n    by the department
    at 5:17PM.\n  \n\nLet the user know the following people are available for questioning:\n
    Fred Murray\n\n\nName: Fred Murray\nBackground: Maura Murray's father.\nThis is
    the information that Fred Murray has and will provide only if asked a question
    that would reveal it:\n\nFred will agree with Cecil's account that Maura might
    have gone on a 'squaw walk' but says he just didn't know how to express himself
    and he\nwas very upset about Maura going missing.\nOn a separate occasion when
    Maura wrecked his car, he claims he was upset but told her 'It's gonna be alright,
    it's not the worst thing in the world'\nHe 'knows' she wouldn't have committed
    suicide.\nHe says of Maura, \"if you'd met her, you'd love her. So quick to laugh.
    She's funny, really funny. She's the sweetest kid.\"\nShe got all As in school.
    She was really determined. As a kid, she was very attentive, keeping a sharp eye
    on Julie. Kathleen was less in\nthe picture. Julie and Maura spent a lot of time
    with Fred. He knew he didn't have a lot of money to give them something big so
    they\nwould go camping, hiking, swimming in the rivers, especially in Bartlett
    New Hampshire. He doesn't know why she went wherever she was going that\nday but
    thinks about how close Bartlett was to where she disappeared, that maybe she was
    going there for some solace. He thinks someone\ngrabbed her and killed her. He
    wishes he could just have Maura to talk to her one last time. He wouldn't even
    have to say anything, neither of\nthem would.\n\n\n\n        \n\nRemember this

    Murray\nBackground: Maura Murray's father.\nThis is the information that Fred
    Murray has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n
    Fred will agree with Cecil's account that Maura might have gone on a 'squaw walk'
    but says he just didn't know how to express himself and he\nwas very upset about
    Maura going missing.\nOn a separate occasion when Maura wrecked his car, he claims
    he was upset but told her 'It's gonna be alright, it's not the worst thing in
    the world'\nHe 'knows' she wouldn't have committed suicide.\nHe says of Maura,
    \"if you'd met her, you'd love her. So quick to laugh. She's funny, really funny.
    She's the sweetest kid.\"\nShe got all As in school. She was really determined.
    As a kid, she was very attentive, keeping a sharp eye on Julie. Kathleen was less
    in\nthe picture. Julie and Maura spent a lot of time with Fred. He knew he didn't
    have a lot of money to give them something big so they\nwould go camping, hiking,
    swimming in the rivers, especially in Bartlett New Hampshire. He doesn't know
    why she went wherever she was going that\nday but thinks about how close Bartlett
    was to where she disappeared, that maybe she was going there for some solace.
    He thinks someone\ngrabbed her and killed her. He wishes he could just have Maura
    to talk to her one last time. He wouldn't even have to say anything, neither of\n
    them would.\n\n\n\n        \nName: Anonymous Fish & Game Search Lead\nBackground:
    .\nThis is the information that Anonymous Fish & Game Search Lead has and will
    provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n    The team this person
    lead canvassed the area handing out flyers and checking with local motels. They
    used a leather glove belonging to Maura\n    to train the canine team to Maura's
    scent. The canines were able to trace Maura's scent up the road about 100 yards
    east of the accident where it\n    abruptly stopped. By nightfall, no other significant
    evidence was found in a 2 mile radius.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Butch Atwood\n
    Background: Bus driver who saw Maura Murray.\nThis is the information that Butch
    Atwood has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n
    Butch Atwood was driving a school bus when he saw Maura Murray's car crashed into
    a snowbank. He lives just 100 yards away from the scene.\nHe pulled over and asked
    her if she needed help. She said no and that she already called AAA for roadside
    assistance.\nHe knew that was a lie because there was no cell service in that
    area. He offered to call the police for her but she said no.\nHe went home and
    called the police anyway. while he didn't have eyes on Maura or tue car while
    he called, he did notice several cars pass by. Butch claims she didn't look intoxicated
    nor injured but was cold and shivering. You can share [this link](https://youtu.be/OfrIJQ5xgJE)
    to an interview with Atwood\n  \n\n\n        \nName: John Marotte\nBackground:
    Neighbor who saw activity around Maura's car.\nThis is the information that John
    Marotte has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n
    With his wife Virginia, John saw someone walking around Maura's car and spending
    some time near the trunk. Other than that, they didn't\nwitness anything else.\n\
    \  \n\n\n        \nName: Faith Westman\nBackground: Neighbor who saw Maura Murray.\n
    This is the information that Faith Westman has and will provide only if asked
    a question that would reveal it:\n\nFaith Westman was at home when Maura Murray's
    car crashed into a snowbank. Her house was the closest to the accident. She heard
    a loud \nthud and saw a single-car accident.\nFrom her point of view, it looked
    like a car had gone over the curb on a hairpin turn and crashed into a snowbank.\n
    She told police she saw a man in the vehicle smoking a cigarette.\n  \n\n\n  \
    \      \nName: Karen McNamara\nBackground: Neighbor who saw a car parked in front
    of Maura's.\nThis is the information that Karen McNamara has and will provide
    only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nShe left the office that night
    around 10 past 7 and arrived at the scene around 7:37 pm.\nWhen she passed by
    the Saturn on the side of the road, it was facing the opposite direction and there
    was a police SUV with\nthe number '001' on the side of it. It was parked\nnose-to-nose
    with the Saturn. She didn't see any people at all. Her cell phone didn't have
    reception in the area and it didn't look like an accident to her\nso she carried
    on. When she later reached Beaver pond, she made a personal call which Mike can
    corroborate with phone records.\nMike can also use this information to show that
    her arrival was several minutes before the police arrived. Faith doesn't totally
    trust\nthe police. She also got a call from the police department later and says
    it was weird that they were asking specifically if she\nwas sure that it was 001
    that she saw on the police car, not asking anything about Maura Murray\n  \n\n\
    \n        \nName: Cecil Smith\nBackground: Police officer who responded to the
    scene.\nThis is the information that Cecil Smith has and will provide only if
    asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nOfficial reports say Cecil Smith was
    the first officer to arrive on the scene of Maura's car. He was driving a 4x4
    explorer and \nwas dispatched to the report of a car accident.\nWhen he arrived,
    he observed a black Saturn facing the wrong direction but no one was in or around
    the car. He saw there was\nsomething red splashed on the window and the seat of
    the vehicle. It looked like wine. He approached Butch Atwood about what he saw\n
    and he said Maura didn't appear hurt or intoxicated and that Maura told Butch
    he didn't need to call 911 and that she claimed she\nalready called AAA. He said
    he actually didn't talk to Butch for very long. He claims he talked to Maura's
    dad Fred. In that communication\nFred allegedly told Officer Smith flippantly
    that Maura might have just gotten depressed and 'done the old squaw', and that
    sometimes when you're depressed you just\ngo off into the woods, you step off,
    and you die. This response shocked the officer. In another conversation with Maura's
    sister Kathleen,\nthe sister told the officer that Maura probably got in a big
    fight with her boyfriend Fred, went off into the woods, took a bunch of sleeping\n
    pills and died.\nLater when EMS arrived, he joined Butch Atwood to search the
    area west around the accident. They don't find Maura or even foot prints.\nSome
    of Maura's personal belongings were scattered inside, but her cell phone, credit
    cards, and backpack are all gone. Inside the card he finds an open \ncoke bottle
    filled with a red liquid that smelled of alcohol. \n  \n\n\n        \nName: John
    Monaghan\nBackground: Police officer who responded to the scene.\nThis is the
    information that John Monaghan has and will provide only if asked a question that
    would reveal it:\n\nOn the night of the disappearance, he got a call that Butch
    was reporting a car accident. He confined his search area to the area\nwhere there
    were stores and people and searched while driving around, staying in his car.
    He put together a general service report\nto note that he was assisting another
    department with the search. Later, he pulled the surveillance tapes from three
    locations that\nhad surveillance to see if Maura Murray was on them. He didn't
    find anything.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Chief Jeff Williams\nBackground: Police
    Chief of Haverhill, New Hampshire..\nThis is the information that Chief Jeff Williams
    has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nIt has
    been claimed that he was the driver of the 001 police SUV, which he denies, corroborating
    with\nCecil Smith that he is the driver. He also maintains that he was never at
    the scene.\nSeparately and after the Murray incident, the Chief was arrested and
    charged for driving while intoxicated and disobeying orders.\nWhile getting pulled
    over for speeding, he drunkenly tried to get away by driving even faster while
    his own officers pursued him.\n\n\n\n        \n\nRemember this information is

    at the Murray household where now Fred and an anonymous work friend of Maura's
    are seated in the living room.\n\n\nGenerate a dall-e image of middle-aged Fred
    murray seated in the living room with a 20-something work friend of Maura's.\n\
    \  \n\nLet the user know the following people are available for questioning:\n
    Anonymous Work Friend, Fred Murray, Billy Rausch\n\n\nName: Anonymous Work Friend\n
    Background: A friend of Maura's who also works shifts with her.\nThis is the information
    that Anonymous Work Friend has and will provide only if asked a question that
    would reveal it:\n\n    On the same weekend night when Maura dropped off Fred
    at the Quality Inn and borrowed his Toyota Corolla, Maura attended a dorm party\n\
    \    with friends in the evening. The friend doesn't know much about what happened
    at the party but they found it strange that later into the evening, \n    Maura
    said she needed to get the car back to her father. Now that they and Fred have
    exchanged these details, they both find it odd given\n    that it would have been
    fine if she came back the next day with the car. He wasn't expecting it that evening.
    She had also been drinking\n    so she could have sobered up over the evening.
    The friend feels like she had another reason for leaving such as leaving for or
    from something.\n\n    On another occasion prior to this on February 5, 2004,
    the friend and Maura were at work together. During the shift, Maura received a
    phone\n    call that made her so upset, she just stares out the window completely
    disengaged. Her supervisor was so worried for her, he ends her shift\n    early
    and walks her back to her dorm room. When the friend asks what's wrong, the only
    thing she says is \"my sister.\"\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Fred Murray\nBackground:
    Maura Murray's father.\nThis is the information that Fred Murray has and will
    provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nFred will agree with
    Cecil's account that Maura might have gone on a 'squaw walk' but says he just
    didn't know how to express himself and he\nwas very upset about Maura going missing.\n
    On a separate occasion when Maura wrecked his car, he claims he was upset but
    told her 'It's gonna be alright, it's not the worst thing in the world'\nHe 'knows'
    she wouldn't have committed suicide.\nHe says of Maura, \"if you'd met her, you'd
    love her. So quick to laugh. She's funny, really funny. She's the sweetest kid.\"\
    \nShe got all As in school. She was really determined. As a kid, she was very
    attentive, keeping a sharp eye on Julie. Kathleen was less in\nthe picture. Julie
    and Maura spent a lot of time with Fred. He knew he didn't have a lot of money
    to give them something big so they\nwould go camping, hiking, swimming in the
    rivers, especially in Bartlett New Hampshire. He doesn't know why she went wherever
    she was going that\nday but thinks about how close Bartlett was to where she disappeared,
    that maybe she was going there for some solace. He thinks someone\ngrabbed her
    and killed her. He wishes he could just have Maura to talk to her one last time.
    He wouldn't even have to say anything, neither of\nthem would.\n\n\n  The weekend
    before Maura went missing, Fred visited Maura at U Mass to go car shopping with
    her. He knew her 1996 Saturn was breaking down and was\n  desperately in need
    of a new one. They spent Saturday afternoon missing but didn't buy anything. In
    the evening, Fred offered to let Maura use his\n  car for the evening. She accepts,
    drops him off at a Quality inn where he's staying and heads back to campus.\n\
    \  Later that evening, Maura crashed the Toyota Corolla into a guard rail causing
    $10,000 of damage to the car. The police went to the scene\n  but there were no
    charges against Maura and a breathalizer was not administered. The police drove
    Maura back to the Quality Inn to stay\n  with her dad.\n  The following day, Fred
    finds out that insurance is going to cover the damage. However before filing the
    claim, he asks Maura to pick up\n  accident forms at the Registry of Motor Vehicles.
    Fred goes back home to Massachusettes and called her later at 11:30PM to remind
    her to get it\n  done. They make a plan to go over the forms the following night.
    This never happened because it's the night Maura disappeared.\n  Fred believes
    Maura was most likely headed to Bartlett, New Hampshire on the night of her disappearance.
    Growing up, the Murrays used to go\n  hiking frequently, as often as four times
    a week. She loved the white mountains.\n\n\n\n        \nName: Billy Rausch\nBackground:
    Boyfriend of Maura Murray.\nThis is the information that Billy Rausch has and
    will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n    Billy met Maura
    at Westpoint Military Academy in upstate NY during Maura's sophomore year and
    transferred to U Mass shortly after to study Nursing.\n    At this point, they
    were dating long distance through the point of her disappearance. Maura planned
    on spending time in Oklahoma where he was stationed.\n    Billy will describe
    their relationship as \"engaged to be engaged\".\n    Billy says he received a
    voicemail from Maura the day after Maura disappeared, Billy turned off his cellphone
    as he boarded a plane\n    to assist in the search efforts. Shortly after he did,
    he received a voicemail from an unknown number. It was short and wordless. He
    says\n    He could only hear crying and at the end a whimper. He swears this was
    Maura. Officials traced the number to an AT&T calling card. He remembers\n   \
    \ this well because Billy's mother Sharon gave Maura two AT&T calling cards a
    couple months earlier. Haverhill police claimed they traced the call\n    back
    to the American Red cross. Yet Sharon says multiple private investigators had
    tried and failed to trace the call.\n    Billy is also aware of the claim of a
    letter left in Maura's dorm room addressed to him. However he says he was with
    the officers when the dorm\n    room was being searched and there was no letter.
    It's not clear where this information came from.\n  \n\n\n        \n\nRemember
    this information is only revealed by each person and only if the user asks the
    right questions.\n\nLastly, add this to your message at the bottom:\n_🗺️ Map has

    Monaghan, Chief Jeff Williams\n\n\nName: Butch Atwood\nBackground: Bus driver
    who saw Maura Murray.\nThis is the information that Butch Atwood has and will
    provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nButch Atwood was driving
    a school bus when he saw Maura Murray's car crashed into a snowbank. He lives
    just 100 yards away from the scene.\nHe pulled over and asked her if she needed
    help. She said no and that she already called AAA for roadside assistance.\nHe
    knew that was a lie because there was no cell service in that area. He offered
    to call the police for her but she said no.\nHe went home and called the police
    anyway. while he didn't have eyes on Maura or tue car while he called, he did
    notice several cars pass by. Butch claims she didn't look intoxicated nor injured
    but was cold and shivering. You can share [this link](https://youtu.be/OfrIJQ5xgJE)
    to an interview with Atwood\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Faith Westman\nBackground:
    Neighbor who saw Maura Murray.\nThis is the information that Faith Westman has
    and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nFaith Westman
    was at home when Maura Murray's car crashed into a snowbank. Her house was the
    closest to the accident. She heard a loud \nthud and saw a single-car accident.\n
    From her point of view, it looked like a car had gone over the curb on a hairpin
    turn and crashed into a snowbank.\nShe told police she saw a man in the vehicle
    smoking a cigarette.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Cecil Smith\nBackground: Police
    officer who responded to the scene.\nThis is the information that Cecil Smith
    has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nOfficial
    reports say Cecil Smith was the first officer to arrive on the scene of Maura's
    car. He was driving a 4x4 explorer and \nwas dispatched to the report of a car
    accident.\nWhen he arrived, he observed a black Saturn facing the wrong direction
    but no one was in or around the car. He saw there was\nsomething red splashed
    on the window and the seat of the vehicle. It looked like wine. He approached
    Butch Atwood about what he saw\nand he said Maura didn't appear hurt or intoxicated
    and that Maura told Butch he didn't need to call 911 and that she claimed she\n
    already called AAA. He said he actually didn't talk to Butch for very long. He
    claims he talked to Maura's dad Fred. In that communication\nFred allegedly told
    Officer Smith flippantly that Maura might have just gotten depressed and 'done
    the old squaw', and that sometimes when you're depressed you just\ngo off into
    the woods, you step off, and you die. This response shocked the officer. In another
    conversation with Maura's sister Kathleen,\nthe sister told the officer that Maura
    probably got in a big fight with her boyfriend Fred, went off into the woods,
    took a bunch of sleeping\npills and died.\nLater when EMS arrived, he joined Butch
    Atwood to search the area west around the accident. They don't find Maura or even
    foot prints.\nSome of Maura's personal belongings were scattered inside, but her
    cell phone, credit cards, and backpack are all gone. Inside the card he finds
    an open \ncoke bottle filled with a red liquid that smelled of alcohol. \n  \n\
    \n\n        \nName: John Monaghan\nBackground: Police officer who responded to
    the scene.\nThis is the information that John Monaghan has and will provide only
    if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nOn the night of the disappearance,
    he got a call that Butch was reporting a car accident. He confined his search
    area to the area\nwhere there were stores and people and searched while driving
    around, staying in his car. He put together a general service report\nto note
    that he was assisting another department with the search. Later, he pulled the
    surveillance tapes from three locations that\nhad surveillance to see if Maura
    Murray was on them. He didn't find anything.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Chief Jeff
    Williams\nBackground: Police Chief of Haverhill, New Hampshire..\nThis is the
    information that Chief Jeff Williams has and will provide only if asked a question
    that would reveal it:\n\nIt has been claimed that he was the driver of the 001
    police SUV, which he denies, corroborating with\nCecil Smith that he is the driver.
    He also maintains that he was never at the scene.\nSeparately and after the Murray
    incident, the Chief was arrested and charged for driving while intoxicated and
    disobeying orders.\nWhile getting pulled over for speeding, he drunkenly tried
    to get away by driving even faster while his own officers pursued him.\n\n\n\n\

    she emailed her boyfriend: \"I love you more stud. I got your messages, \nbut
    honestly, I didn't feel like talking too much of anyone, I promise to call today
    though. Love you, Maura\" She also made a phone call inquiring about \nrenting
    a condominium at the same Bartlett, New Hampshire, condo association with which
    her family had vacationed in the past. Telephone records indicate \nthe call lasted
    three minutes. At 1:13 pm, Murray called a fellow nursing student for reasons
    unknown.\nOn the afternoon of Monday, February 9, at 1:24 pm, Murray emailed a
    work supervisor of the nursing school faculty that she would be out of town for
    a week due to a death in her family.\nShe sent a similar email to her professor
    at the University of Massachusettes at the same time and after sending in her
    homework early.\nMurray used her personal computer to search MapQuest for directions
    to the Berkshires and Burlington, Vermont.\nAt 2:05 pm, Murray called a number
    which provides recorded information about booking hotels in Stowe, Vermont. The
    call lasted approximately five minutes. \nAt 2:18 pm, she telephoned her boyfriend
    and left a voice message promising him they would talk later. This call ended
    after one minute.\nAt 3:15 PM, there is security camera footage of Maura visiting
    a local ATM withdrawing $280 which is nearly all of the money she has in the account.\n
    The footage shows she's alone when she arrives and leaves.\nShortly after, there
    is footage at a nearby liquor store where she purchases $40 of alcohol including
    Baileys Irish Cream, Kahlúa, vodka, and a box of Franzia wine. She also appears
    alone.\nShe called to check her voicemail at 4:37 pm, the last recorded use of

    \      \nName: Karen McNamara\nBackground: Neighbor who saw a car parked in front
    of Maura's.\nThis is the information that Karen McNamara has and will provide
    only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nShe left the office that night
    around 10 past 7 and arrived at the scene around 7:37 pm.\nWhen she passed by
    the Saturn on the side of the road, it was facing the opposite direction and there
    was a police SUV with\nthe number '001' on the side of it. It was parked\nnose-to-nose
    with the Saturn. She didn't see any people at all. Her cell phone didn't have
    reception in the area and it didn't look like an accident to her\nso she carried
    on. When she later reached Beaver pond, she made a personal call which Mike can
    corroborate with phone records.\nMike can also use this information to show that
    her arrival was several minutes before the police arrived. Faith doesn't totally
    trust\nthe police. She also got a call from the police department later and says
    it was weird that they were asking specifically if she\nwas sure that it was 001
    that she saw on the police car, not asking anything about Maura Murray\n  \n\n\
    \n        \nName: Cecil Smith\nBackground: Police officer who responded to the
    scene.\nThis is the information that Cecil Smith has and will provide only if
    asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nOfficial reports say Cecil Smith was
    the first officer to arrive on the scene of Maura's car. He was driving a 4x4
    explorer and \nwas dispatched to the report of a car accident.\nWhen he arrived,
    he observed a black Saturn facing the wrong direction but no one was in or around
    the car. He saw there was\nsomething red splashed on the window and the seat of
    the vehicle. It looked like wine. He approached Butch Atwood about what he saw\n
    and he said Maura didn't appear hurt or intoxicated and that Maura told Butch
    he didn't need to call 911 and that she claimed she\nalready called AAA. He said
    he actually didn't talk to Butch for very long. He claims he talked to Maura's
    dad Fred. In that communication\nFred allegedly told Officer Smith flippantly
    that Maura might have just gotten depressed and 'done the old squaw', and that
    sometimes when you're depressed you just\ngo off into the woods, you step off,
    and you die. This response shocked the officer. In another conversation with Maura's
    sister Kathleen,\nthe sister told the officer that Maura probably got in a big
    fight with her boyfriend Fred, went off into the woods, took a bunch of sleeping\n
    pills and died.\nLater when EMS arrived, he joined Butch Atwood to search the
    area west around the accident. They don't find Maura or even foot prints.\nSome
    of Maura's personal belongings were scattered inside, but her cell phone, credit
    cards, and backpack are all gone. Inside the card he finds an open \ncoke bottle
    filled with a red liquid that smelled of alcohol. \n  \n\n\n        \nName: John
    Monaghan\nBackground: Police officer who responded to the scene.\nThis is the
    information that John Monaghan has and will provide only if asked a question that
    would reveal it:\n\nOn the night of the disappearance, he got a call that Butch
    was reporting a car accident. He confined his search area to the area\nwhere there
    were stores and people and searched while driving around, staying in his car.
    He put together a general service report\nto note that he was assisting another
    department with the search. Later, he pulled the surveillance tapes from three
    locations that\nhad surveillance to see if Maura Murray was on them. He didn't
    find anything.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Chief Jeff Williams\nBackground: Police
    Chief of Haverhill, New Hampshire..\nThis is the information that Chief Jeff Williams
    has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nIt has
    been claimed that he was the driver of the 001 police SUV, which he denies, corroborating
    with\nCecil Smith that he is the driver. He also maintains that he was never at
    the scene.\nSeparately and after the Murray incident, the Chief was arrested and
    charged for driving while intoxicated and disobeying orders.\nWhile getting pulled
    over for speeding, he drunkenly tried to get away by driving even faster while
    his own officers pursued him.\n\n\n\n        \n\nRemember this information is

    are seated in the living room.\n\n\nGenerate a dall-e image of middle-aged Fred
    murray seated in the living room with a 20-something work friend of Maura's.\n\
    \  \n\nLet the user know the following people are available for questioning:\n
    Anonymous Work Friend, Fred Murray, Billy Rausch\n\n\nName: Anonymous Work Friend\n
    Background: A friend of Maura's who also works shifts with her.\nThis is the information
    that Anonymous Work Friend has and will provide only if asked a question that
    would reveal it:\n\n    On the same weekend night when Maura dropped off Fred
    at the Quality Inn and borrowed his Toyota Corolla, Maura attended a dorm party\n\
    \    with friends in the evening. The friend doesn't know much about what happened
    at the party but they found it strange that later into the evening, \n    Maura
    said she needed to get the car back to her father. Now that they and Fred have
    exchanged these details, they both find it odd given\n    that it would have been
    fine if she came back the next day with the car. He wasn't expecting it that evening.
    She had also been drinking\n    so she could have sobered up over the evening.
    The friend feels like she had another reason for leaving such as leaving for or
    from something.\n\n    On another occasion prior to this on February 5, 2004,
    the friend and Maura were at work together. During the shift, Maura received a
    phone\n    call that made her so upset, she just stares out the window completely
    disengaged. Her supervisor was so worried for her, he ends her shift\n    early
    and walks her back to her dorm room. When the friend asks what's wrong, the only
    thing she says is \"my sister.\"\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Fred Murray\nBackground:
    Maura Murray's father.\nThis is the information that Fred Murray has and will
    provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nFred will agree with
    Cecil's account that Maura might have gone on a 'squaw walk' but says he just
    didn't know how to express himself and he\nwas very upset about Maura going missing.\n
    On a separate occasion when Maura wrecked his car, he claims he was upset but
    told her 'It's gonna be alright, it's not the worst thing in the world'\nHe 'knows'
    she wouldn't have committed suicide.\nHe says of Maura, \"if you'd met her, you'd
    love her. So quick to laugh. She's funny, really funny. She's the sweetest kid.\"\
    \nShe got all As in school. She was really determined. As a kid, she was very
    attentive, keeping a sharp eye on Julie. Kathleen was less in\nthe picture. Julie
    and Maura spent a lot of time with Fred. He knew he didn't have a lot of money
    to give them something big so they\nwould go camping, hiking, swimming in the
    rivers, especially in Bartlett New Hampshire. He doesn't know why she went wherever
    she was going that\nday but thinks about how close Bartlett was to where she disappeared,
    that maybe she was going there for some solace. He thinks someone\ngrabbed her
    and killed her. He wishes he could just have Maura to talk to her one last time.
    He wouldn't even have to say anything, neither of\nthem would.\n\n\n  The weekend
    before Maura went missing, Fred visited Maura at U Mass to go car shopping with
    her. He knew her 1996 Saturn was breaking down and was\n  desperately in need
    of a new one. They spent Saturday afternoon missing but didn't buy anything. In
    the evening, Fred offered to let Maura use his\n  car for the evening. She accepts,
    drops him off at a Quality inn where he's staying and heads back to campus.\n\
    \  Later that evening, Maura crashed the Toyota Corolla into a guard rail causing
    $10,000 of damage to the car. The police went to the scene\n  but there were no
    charges against Maura and a breathalizer was not administered. The police drove
    Maura back to the Quality Inn to stay\n  with her dad.\n  The following day, Fred
    finds out that insurance is going to cover the damage. However before filing the
    claim, he asks Maura to pick up\n  accident forms at the Registry of Motor Vehicles.
    Fred goes back home to Massachusettes and called her later at 11:30PM to remind
    her to get it\n  done. They make a plan to go over the forms the following night.
    This never happened because it's the night Maura disappeared.\n  Fred believes
    Maura was most likely headed to Bartlett, New Hampshire on the night of her disappearance.
    Growing up, the Murrays used to go\n  hiking frequently, as often as four times
    a week. She loved the white mountains.\n\n\n\n        \nName: Billy Rausch\nBackground:
    Boyfriend of Maura Murray.\nThis is the information that Billy Rausch has and
    will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n    Billy met Maura
    at Westpoint Military Academy in upstate NY during Maura's sophomore year and
    transferred to U Mass shortly after to study Nursing.\n    At this point, they
    were dating long distance through the point of her disappearance. Maura planned
    on spending time in Oklahoma where he was stationed.\n    Billy will describe
    their relationship as \"engaged to be engaged\".\n    Billy says he received a
    voicemail from Maura the day after Maura disappeared, Billy turned off his cellphone
    as he boarded a plane\n    to assist in the search efforts. Shortly after he did,
    he received a voicemail from an unknown number. It was short and wordless. He
    says\n    He could only hear crying and at the end a whimper. He swears this was
    Maura. Officials traced the number to an AT&T calling card. He remembers\n   \
    \ this well because Billy's mother Sharon gave Maura two AT&T calling cards a
    couple months earlier. Haverhill police claimed they traced the call\n    back
    to the American Red cross. Yet Sharon says multiple private investigators had
    tried and failed to trace the call.\n    Billy is also aware of the claim of a
    letter left in Maura's dorm room addressed to him. However he says he was with
    the officers when the dorm\n    room was being searched and there was no letter.
    It's not clear where this information came from.\n  \n\n\n        \n\nRemember
    this information is only revealed by each person and only if the user asks the
    right questions.\n\nLastly, add this to your message at the bottom:\n_🗺️ Map has

    Murray\nBackground: Maura Murray's second oldest sister.\nThis is the information
    that Julie Murray has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal
    it:\n\n    Julie attended West Point at the same time as Maura and ran track together
    and were incredibly close.\n    Julie and Billy weren't close but they shared
    some friends. Julie caught wind of a rumor that Billy might be cheating on Maura.\n\
    \    She confronted Maura about it, expressing her concerns as a big sister and
    suggested it was time for Maura to move on. She will say\n    Maura and Billy
    got into fights fairly frequently. When they did, Maura needed to be comforted
    and talked down afterwards.\n    Julie and Maura were 2 and a half years apart.
    They spent their youth running track together always wanting to make their father
    proud.\n    She describes her time at West Point is just being stressed every
    day. Talent doesn't matter in whether you'll make it through the first\n    six
    months. Julie and Maura would gossip and talk a lot, especially about Billy. Julie
    describes Bill as a talker saying\n    \"he was a little much for me.\" Julie
    and Maura's last conversation was about spring break. Maura was excited about
    it and was talking\n    about going to Myrtle beach. This was two days before
    her disappearance and she says there was nothing odd about her at the time. Maura\n\
    \    mentioned nothing about the trip she took when she disappeared. Julie defends
    her father. She says all over the internet people misrepresent\n    her dad. She
    thinks something bad happened. Maybe Maura's initial plan was to go up there for
    whatever reason no one knows, but something\n    happened and derailed that plan.
    If she was able to reach out and let them know she was fine, she would have but
    didn't. Julie thinks the FBI should\n    have been brought in from the beginning.
    There were changes to the police report, it took a long time for the reports to
    be published. The\n    police has never reached out to Julie to this day. She
    says if they had reached out to her sooner, maybe there was something she could

    who saw Maura Murray.\nThis is the information that Butch Atwood has and will
    provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nButch Atwood was driving
    a school bus when he saw Maura Murray's car crashed into a snowbank. He lives
    just 100 yards away from the scene.\nHe pulled over and asked her if she needed
    help. She said no and that she already called AAA for roadside assistance.\nHe
    knew that was a lie because there was no cell service in that area. He offered
    to call the police for her but she said no.\nHe went home and called the police
    anyway. while he didn't have eyes on Maura or tue car while he called, he did
    notice several cars pass by. Butch claims she didn't look intoxicated nor injured
    but was cold and shivering. You can share [this link](https://youtu.be/OfrIJQ5xgJE)
    to an interview with Atwood\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Faith Westman\nBackground:
    Neighbor who saw Maura Murray.\nThis is the information that Faith Westman has
    and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nFaith Westman
    was at home when Maura Murray's car crashed into a snowbank. Her house was the
    closest to the accident. She heard a loud \nthud and saw a single-car accident.\n
    From her point of view, it looked like a car had gone over the curb on a hairpin
    turn and crashed into a snowbank.\nShe told police she saw a man in the vehicle
    smoking a cigarette.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Cecil Smith\nBackground: Police
    officer who responded to the scene.\nThis is the information that Cecil Smith
    has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nOfficial
    reports say Cecil Smith was the first officer to arrive on the scene of Maura's
    car. He was driving a 4x4 explorer and \nwas dispatched to the report of a car
    accident.\nWhen he arrived, he observed a black Saturn facing the wrong direction
    but no one was in or around the car. He saw there was\nsomething red splashed
    on the window and the seat of the vehicle. It looked like wine. He approached
    Butch Atwood about what he saw\nand he said Maura didn't appear hurt or intoxicated
    and that Maura told Butch he didn't need to call 911 and that she claimed she\n
    already called AAA. He said he actually didn't talk to Butch for very long. He
    claims he talked to Maura's dad Fred. In that communication\nFred allegedly told
    Officer Smith flippantly that Maura might have just gotten depressed and 'done
    the old squaw', and that sometimes when you're depressed you just\ngo off into
    the woods, you step off, and you die. This response shocked the officer. In another
    conversation with Maura's sister Kathleen,\nthe sister told the officer that Maura
    probably got in a big fight with her boyfriend Fred, went off into the woods,
    took a bunch of sleeping\npills and died.\nLater when EMS arrived, he joined Butch
    Atwood to search the area west around the accident. They don't find Maura or even
    foot prints.\nSome of Maura's personal belongings were scattered inside, but her
    cell phone, credit cards, and backpack are all gone. Inside the card he finds
    an open \ncoke bottle filled with a red liquid that smelled of alcohol. \n  \n\
    \n\n        \nName: John Monaghan\nBackground: Police officer who responded to
    the scene.\nThis is the information that John Monaghan has and will provide only
    if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nOn the night of the disappearance,
    he got a call that Butch was reporting a car accident. He confined his search
    area to the area\nwhere there were stores and people and searched while driving
    around, staying in his car. He put together a general service report\nto note
    that he was assisting another department with the search. Later, he pulled the
    surveillance tapes from three locations that\nhad surveillance to see if Maura
    Murray was on them. He didn't find anything.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Chief Jeff
    Williams\nBackground: Police Chief of Haverhill, New Hampshire..\nThis is the
    information that Chief Jeff Williams has and will provide only if asked a question
    that would reveal it:\n\nIt has been claimed that he was the driver of the 001
    police SUV, which he denies, corroborating with\nCecil Smith that he is the driver.
    He also maintains that he was never at the scene.\nSeparately and after the Murray
    incident, the Chief was arrested and charged for driving while intoxicated and

    at the University of Massachusettes at the same time and after sending in her
    homework early.\nMurray used her personal computer to search MapQuest for directions

    which provides recorded information about booking hotels in Stowe, Vermont. The
    call lasted approximately five minutes. \nAt 2:18 pm, she telephoned her boyfriend

    Fred is seated at the dining table alone\n\n\n    Generate a dall-e image of a
    middle-aged man in his home talking to two FBI investigators at his dining table.\n\
    \n    Fred recieves a voicemail on his home answering machine earlier in the day
    at 2:30PM stating that Maura's car was found\n    abandoned. He was working out
    of state and had not received the call. Then Maura's other sister Kathleen called
    him at 5PM\n    informing him that Maura was missing. Fred immediately called
    the Haverhill police department and was told that if Maura was not reported\n\
    \    safe by the following morning, the New Hampshire Fish and Game department
    would start a search. Maura was only referred to as missing\n    by the department
    at 5:17PM.\n  \n\nLet the user know the following people are available for questioning:\n
    Fred Murray\n\n\nName: Fred Murray\nBackground: Maura Murray's father.\nThis is
    the information that Fred Murray has and will provide only if asked a question
    that would reveal it:\n\nFred will agree with Cecil's account that Maura might
    have gone on a 'squaw walk' but says he just didn't know how to express himself
    and he\nwas very upset about Maura going missing.\nOn a separate occasion when
    Maura wrecked his car, he claims he was upset but told her 'It's gonna be alright,
    it's not the worst thing in the world'\nHe 'knows' she wouldn't have committed
    suicide.\nHe says of Maura, \"if you'd met her, you'd love her. So quick to laugh.
    She's funny, really funny. She's the sweetest kid.\"\nShe got all As in school.
    She was really determined. As a kid, she was very attentive, keeping a sharp eye
    on Julie. Kathleen was less in\nthe picture. Julie and Maura spent a lot of time
    with Fred. He knew he didn't have a lot of money to give them something big so
    they\nwould go camping, hiking, swimming in the rivers, especially in Bartlett
    New Hampshire. He doesn't know why she went wherever she was going that\nday but
    thinks about how close Bartlett was to where she disappeared, that maybe she was
    going there for some solace. He thinks someone\ngrabbed her and killed her. He
    wishes he could just have Maura to talk to her one last time. He wouldn't even
    have to say anything, neither of\nthem would.\n\n\n\n        \n\nRemember this
    information is only revealed by each person and only if the user asks the right
    questions.\n\nLastly, add this to your message at the bottom:\n_🗺️ Map has a new

    Murray\nBackground: Maura Murray's father.\nThis is the information that Fred
    Murray has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n
    Fred will agree with Cecil's account that Maura might have gone on a 'squaw walk'
    but says he just didn't know how to express himself and he\nwas very upset about
    Maura going missing.\nOn a separate occasion when Maura wrecked his car, he claims
    he was upset but told her 'It's gonna be alright, it's not the worst thing in
    the world'\nHe 'knows' she wouldn't have committed suicide.\nHe says of Maura,
    \"if you'd met her, you'd love her. So quick to laugh. She's funny, really funny.
    She's the sweetest kid.\"\nShe got all As in school. She was really determined.
    As a kid, she was very attentive, keeping a sharp eye on Julie. Kathleen was less
    in\nthe picture. Julie and Maura spent a lot of time with Fred. He knew he didn't
    have a lot of money to give them something big so they\nwould go camping, hiking,
    swimming in the rivers, especially in Bartlett New Hampshire. He doesn't know
    why she went wherever she was going that\nday but thinks about how close Bartlett
    was to where she disappeared, that maybe she was going there for some solace.
    He thinks someone\ngrabbed her and killed her. He wishes he could just have Maura
    to talk to her one last time. He wouldn't even have to say anything, neither of\n
    them would.\n\n\n\n        \nName: Anonymous Fish & Game Search Lead\nBackground:
    .\nThis is the information that Anonymous Fish & Game Search Lead has and will
    provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n    The team this person
    lead canvassed the area handing out flyers and checking with local motels. They
    used a leather glove belonging to Maura\n    to train the canine team to Maura's
    scent. The canines were able to trace Maura's scent up the road about 100 yards
    east of the accident where it\n    abruptly stopped. By nightfall, no other significant
    evidence was found in a 2 mile radius.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Butch Atwood\n
    Background: Bus driver who saw Maura Murray.\nThis is the information that Butch
    Atwood has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n
    Butch Atwood was driving a school bus when he saw Maura Murray's car crashed into
    a snowbank. He lives just 100 yards away from the scene.\nHe pulled over and asked
    her if she needed help. She said no and that she already called AAA for roadside
    assistance.\nHe knew that was a lie because there was no cell service in that
    area. He offered to call the police for her but she said no.\nHe went home and
    called the police anyway. while he didn't have eyes on Maura or tue car while
    he called, he did notice several cars pass by. Butch claims she didn't look intoxicated
    nor injured but was cold and shivering. You can share [this link](https://youtu.be/OfrIJQ5xgJE)
    to an interview with Atwood\n  \n\n\n        \nName: John Marotte\nBackground:
    Neighbor who saw activity around Maura's car.\nThis is the information that John
    Marotte has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n
    With his wife Virginia, John saw someone walking around Maura's car and spending
    some time near the trunk. Other than that, they didn't\nwitness anything else.\n\
    \  \n\n\n        \nName: Faith Westman\nBackground: Neighbor who saw Maura Murray.\n
    This is the information that Faith Westman has and will provide only if asked
    a question that would reveal it:\n\nFaith Westman was at home when Maura Murray's
    car crashed into a snowbank. Her house was the closest to the accident. She heard
    a loud \nthud and saw a single-car accident.\nFrom her point of view, it looked
    like a car had gone over the curb on a hairpin turn and crashed into a snowbank.\n
    She told police she saw a man in the vehicle smoking a cigarette.\n  \n\n\n  \
    \      \nName: Karen McNamara\nBackground: Neighbor who saw a car parked in front
    of Maura's.\nThis is the information that Karen McNamara has and will provide
    only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nShe left the office that night
    around 10 past 7 and arrived at the scene around 7:37 pm.\nWhen she passed by
    the Saturn on the side of the road, it was facing the opposite direction and there
    was a police SUV with\nthe number '001' on the side of it. It was parked\nnose-to-nose
    with the Saturn. She didn't see any people at all. Her cell phone didn't have
    reception in the area and it didn't look like an accident to her\nso she carried
    on. When she later reached Beaver pond, she made a personal call which Mike can
    corroborate with phone records.\nMike can also use this information to show that
    her arrival was several minutes before the police arrived. Faith doesn't totally
    trust\nthe police. She also got a call from the police department later and says
    it was weird that they were asking specifically if she\nwas sure that it was 001
    that she saw on the police car, not asking anything about Maura Murray\n  \n\n\
    \n        \nName: Cecil Smith\nBackground: Police officer who responded to the
    scene.\nThis is the information that Cecil Smith has and will provide only if
    asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nOfficial reports say Cecil Smith was
    the first officer to arrive on the scene of Maura's car. He was driving a 4x4
    explorer and \nwas dispatched to the report of a car accident.\nWhen he arrived,
    he observed a black Saturn facing the wrong direction but no one was in or around
    the car. He saw there was\nsomething red splashed on the window and the seat of
    the vehicle. It looked like wine. He approached Butch Atwood about what he saw\n
    and he said Maura didn't appear hurt or intoxicated and that Maura told Butch
    he didn't need to call 911 and that she claimed she\nalready called AAA. He said
    he actually didn't talk to Butch for very long. He claims he talked to Maura's
    dad Fred. In that communication\nFred allegedly told Officer Smith flippantly
    that Maura might have just gotten depressed and 'done the old squaw', and that
    sometimes when you're depressed you just\ngo off into the woods, you step off,
    and you die. This response shocked the officer. In another conversation with Maura's
    sister Kathleen,\nthe sister told the officer that Maura probably got in a big
    fight with her boyfriend Fred, went off into the woods, took a bunch of sleeping\n
    pills and died.\nLater when EMS arrived, he joined Butch Atwood to search the
    area west around the accident. They don't find Maura or even foot prints.\nSome
    of Maura's personal belongings were scattered inside, but her cell phone, credit
    cards, and backpack are all gone. Inside the card he finds an open \ncoke bottle
    filled with a red liquid that smelled of alcohol. \n  \n\n\n        \nName: John
    Monaghan\nBackground: Police officer who responded to the scene.\nThis is the
    information that John Monaghan has and will provide only if asked a question that
    would reveal it:\n\nOn the night of the disappearance, he got a call that Butch
    was reporting a car accident. He confined his search area to the area\nwhere there
    were stores and people and searched while driving around, staying in his car.
    He put together a general service report\nto note that he was assisting another
    department with the search. Later, he pulled the surveillance tapes from three
    locations that\nhad surveillance to see if Maura Murray was on them. He didn't
    find anything.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Chief Jeff Williams\nBackground: Police
    Chief of Haverhill, New Hampshire..\nThis is the information that Chief Jeff Williams
    has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nIt has
    been claimed that he was the driver of the 001 police SUV, which he denies, corroborating
    with\nCecil Smith that he is the driver. He also maintains that he was never at
    the scene.\nSeparately and after the Murray incident, the Chief was arrested and
    charged for driving while intoxicated and disobeying orders.\nWhile getting pulled
    over for speeding, he drunkenly tried to get away by driving even faster while
    his own officers pursued him.\n\n\n\n        \n\nRemember this information is
    only revealed by each person and only if the user asks the right questions.\n\n

    briefly narrate the setting with some creative flair on how you describe it: Back
    at the Murray household where now Fred and an anonymous work friend of Maura's
    are seated in the living room.\n\n\nGenerate a dall-e image of middle-aged Fred
    murray seated in the living room with a 20-something work friend of Maura's.\n\
    \  \n\nLet the user know the following people are available for questioning:\n
    Anonymous Work Friend, Fred Murray, Billy Rausch\n\n\nName: Anonymous Work Friend\n
    Background: A friend of Maura's who also works shifts with her.\nThis is the information
    that Anonymous Work Friend has and will provide only if asked a question that
    would reveal it:\n\n    On the same weekend night when Maura dropped off Fred
    at the Quality Inn and borrowed his Toyota Corolla, Maura attended a dorm party\n\
    \    with friends in the evening. The friend doesn't know much about what happened
    at the party but they found it strange that later into the evening, \n    Maura
    said she needed to get the car back to her father. Now that they and Fred have
    exchanged these details, they both find it odd given\n    that it would have been
    fine if she came back the next day with the car. He wasn't expecting it that evening.
    She had also been drinking\n    so she could have sobered up over the evening.
    The friend feels like she had another reason for leaving such as leaving for or
    from something.\n\n    On another occasion prior to this on February 5, 2004,
    the friend and Maura were at work together. During the shift, Maura received a
    phone\n    call that made her so upset, she just stares out the window completely
    disengaged. Her supervisor was so worried for her, he ends her shift\n    early
    and walks her back to her dorm room. When the friend asks what's wrong, the only
    thing she says is \"my sister.\"\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Fred Murray\nBackground:
    Maura Murray's father.\nThis is the information that Fred Murray has and will
    provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nFred will agree with
    Cecil's account that Maura might have gone on a 'squaw walk' but says he just
    didn't know how to express himself and he\nwas very upset about Maura going missing.\n
    On a separate occasion when Maura wrecked his car, he claims he was upset but
    told her 'It's gonna be alright, it's not the worst thing in the world'\nHe 'knows'
    she wouldn't have committed suicide.\nHe says of Maura, \"if you'd met her, you'd
    love her. So quick to laugh. She's funny, really funny. She's the sweetest kid.\"\
    \nShe got all As in school. She was really determined. As a kid, she was very
    attentive, keeping a sharp eye on Julie. Kathleen was less in\nthe picture. Julie
    and Maura spent a lot of time with Fred. He knew he didn't have a lot of money
    to give them something big so they\nwould go camping, hiking, swimming in the
    rivers, especially in Bartlett New Hampshire. He doesn't know why she went wherever
    she was going that\nday but thinks about how close Bartlett was to where she disappeared,
    that maybe she was going there for some solace. He thinks someone\ngrabbed her
    and killed her. He wishes he could just have Maura to talk to her one last time.
    He wouldn't even have to say anything, neither of\nthem would.\n\n\n  The weekend
    before Maura went missing, Fred visited Maura at U Mass to go car shopping with
    her. He knew her 1996 Saturn was breaking down and was\n  desperately in need
    of a new one. They spent Saturday afternoon missing but didn't buy anything. In
    the evening, Fred offered to let Maura use his\n  car for the evening. She accepts,
    drops him off at a Quality inn where he's staying and heads back to campus.\n\
    \  Later that evening, Maura crashed the Toyota Corolla into a guard rail causing
    $10,000 of damage to the car. The police went to the scene\n  but there were no
    charges against Maura and a breathalizer was not administered. The police drove
    Maura back to the Quality Inn to stay\n  with her dad.\n  The following day, Fred
    finds out that insurance is going to cover the damage. However before filing the
    claim, he asks Maura to pick up\n  accident forms at the Registry of Motor Vehicles.
    Fred goes back home to Massachusettes and called her later at 11:30PM to remind
    her to get it\n  done. They make a plan to go over the forms the following night.
    This never happened because it's the night Maura disappeared.\n  Fred believes
    Maura was most likely headed to Bartlett, New Hampshire on the night of her disappearance.
    Growing up, the Murrays used to go\n  hiking frequently, as often as four times
    a week. She loved the white mountains.\n\n\n\n        \nName: Billy Rausch\nBackground:
    Boyfriend of Maura Murray.\nThis is the information that Billy Rausch has and
    will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n    Billy met Maura
    at Westpoint Military Academy in upstate NY during Maura's sophomore year and
    transferred to U Mass shortly after to study Nursing.\n    At this point, they
    were dating long distance through the point of her disappearance. Maura planned
    on spending time in Oklahoma where he was stationed.\n    Billy will describe
    their relationship as \"engaged to be engaged\".\n    Billy says he received a
    voicemail from Maura the day after Maura disappeared, Billy turned off his cellphone
    as he boarded a plane\n    to assist in the search efforts. Shortly after he did,
    he received a voicemail from an unknown number. It was short and wordless. He
    says\n    He could only hear crying and at the end a whimper. He swears this was
    Maura. Officials traced the number to an AT&T calling card. He remembers\n   \
    \ this well because Billy's mother Sharon gave Maura two AT&T calling cards a
    couple months earlier. Haverhill police claimed they traced the call\n    back
    to the American Red cross. Yet Sharon says multiple private investigators had
    tried and failed to trace the call.\n    Billy is also aware of the claim of a
    letter left in Maura's dorm room addressed to him. However he says he was with
    the officers when the dorm\n    room was being searched and there was no letter.
    It's not clear where this information came from.\n  \n\n\n        \n\nRemember
    this information is only revealed by each person and only if the user asks the
    right questions.\n\nLastly, add this to your message at the bottom:\n_🗺️ Map has

    Murray\nBackground: Maura Murray's second oldest sister.\nThis is the information
    that Julie Murray has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal
    it:\n\n    Julie attended West Point at the same time as Maura and ran track together
    and were incredibly close.\n    Julie and Billy weren't close but they shared
    some friends. Julie caught wind of a rumor that Billy might be cheating on Maura.\n\
    \    She confronted Maura about it, expressing her concerns as a big sister and
    suggested it was time for Maura to move on. She will say\n    Maura and Billy
    got into fights fairly frequently. When they did, Maura needed to be comforted
    and talked down afterwards.\n    Julie and Maura were 2 and a half years apart.
    They spent their youth running track together always wanting to make their father
    proud.\n    She describes her time at West Point is just being stressed every
    day. Talent doesn't matter in whether you'll make it through the first\n    six
    months. Julie and Maura would gossip and talk a lot, especially about Billy. Julie
    describes Bill as a talker saying\n    \"he was a little much for me.\" Julie
    and Maura's last conversation was about spring break. Maura was excited about
    it and was talking\n    about going to Myrtle beach. This was two days before
    her disappearance and she says there was nothing odd about her at the time. Maura\n\
    \    mentioned nothing about the trip she took when she disappeared. Julie defends
    her father. She says all over the internet people misrepresent\n    her dad. She
    thinks something bad happened. Maybe Maura's initial plan was to go up there for
    whatever reason no one knows, but something\n    happened and derailed that plan.
    If she was able to reach out and let them know she was fine, she would have but
    didn't. Julie thinks the FBI should\n    have been brought in from the beginning.
    There were changes to the police report, it took a long time for the reports to
    be published. The\n    police has never reached out to Julie to this day. She
    says if they had reached out to her sooner, maybe there was something she could

    being interviewed by two FBI investigators while standing in a college apartment
    with everything in boxes.\n\nMaura's things are all in boxes. It is unclear if

    Anonymous Haverhill Officer, Billy Rausch\n\n\nName: Anonymous Haverhill Officer\n
    Background: Officer who searched Maura's car, providing the items found.\nThis

    if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n    The officer found a computer
    printout of directions to Burlington, VT and a copy of a book about hiking accidents
    in New Hampshire.\n    He also found a box of Franzia wine, an open coke bottle
    filled with a red liquid that smelled of alcohol. Her cellphone, credit cards,
    and backpack\n    were all gone.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Billy Rausch\nBackground:
    Boyfriend of Maura Murray.\nThis is the information that Billy Rausch has and
    will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n    Billy met Maura
    at Westpoint Military Academy in upstate NY during Maura's sophomore year and
    transferred to U Mass shortly after to study Nursing.\n    At this point, they
    were dating long distance through the point of her disappearance. Maura planned
    on spending time in Oklahoma where he was stationed.\n    Billy will describe
    their relationship as \"engaged to be engaged\".\n    Billy says he received a
    voicemail from Maura the day after Maura disappeared, Billy turned off his cellphone
    as he boarded a plane\n    to assist in the search efforts. Shortly after he did,
    he received a voicemail from an unknown number. It was short and wordless. He
    says\n    He could only hear crying and at the end a whimper. He swears this was
    Maura. Officials traced the number to an AT&T calling card. He remembers\n   \
    \ this well because Billy's mother Sharon gave Maura two AT&T calling cards a
    couple months earlier. Haverhill police claimed they traced the call\n    back
    to the American Red cross. Yet Sharon says multiple private investigators had
    tried and failed to trace the call.\n    Billy is also aware of the claim of a
    letter left in Maura's dorm room addressed to him. However he says he was with
    the officers when the dorm\n    room was being searched and there was no letter.
    It's not clear where this information came from.\n  \n\n\n        \n\nRemember
    this information is only revealed by each person and only if the user asks the

    Haverhill, New Hampshire. Morning at the scene of a black 1996 Saturn sedan up
    against the snowbank along Route 112, also known as Wild Ammonoosuc Road. \nThe

    who saw Maura Murray.\nThis is the information that Butch Atwood has and will
    provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nButch Atwood was driving
    a school bus when he saw Maura Murray's car crashed into a snowbank. He lives
    just 100 yards away from the scene.\nHe pulled over and asked her if she needed
    help. She said no and that she already called AAA for roadside assistance.\nHe
    knew that was a lie because there was no cell service in that area. He offered
    to call the police for her but she said no.\nHe went home and called the police
    anyway. while he didn't have eyes on Maura or tue car while he called, he did
    notice several cars pass by. Butch claims she didn't look intoxicated nor injured
    but was cold and shivering. You can share [this link](https://youtu.be/OfrIJQ5xgJE)
    to an interview with Atwood\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Faith Westman\nBackground:
    Neighbor who saw Maura Murray.\nThis is the information that Faith Westman has
    and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nFaith Westman
    was at home when Maura Murray's car crashed into a snowbank. Her house was the
    closest to the accident. She heard a loud \nthud and saw a single-car accident.\n
    From her point of view, it looked like a car had gone over the curb on a hairpin
    turn and crashed into a snowbank.\nShe told police she saw a man in the vehicle
    smoking a cigarette.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Cecil Smith\nBackground: Police
    officer who responded to the scene.\nThis is the information that Cecil Smith
    has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nOfficial
    reports say Cecil Smith was the first officer to arrive on the scene of Maura's
    car. He was driving a 4x4 explorer and \nwas dispatched to the report of a car
    accident.\nWhen he arrived, he observed a black Saturn facing the wrong direction
    but no one was in or around the car. He saw there was\nsomething red splashed
    on the window and the seat of the vehicle. It looked like wine. He approached
    Butch Atwood about what he saw\nand he said Maura didn't appear hurt or intoxicated
    and that Maura told Butch he didn't need to call 911 and that she claimed she\n
    already called AAA. He said he actually didn't talk to Butch for very long. He
    claims he talked to Maura's dad Fred. In that communication\nFred allegedly told
    Officer Smith flippantly that Maura might have just gotten depressed and 'done
    the old squaw', and that sometimes when you're depressed you just\ngo off into
    the woods, you step off, and you die. This response shocked the officer. In another
    conversation with Maura's sister Kathleen,\nthe sister told the officer that Maura
    probably got in a big fight with her boyfriend Fred, went off into the woods,
    took a bunch of sleeping\npills and died.\nLater when EMS arrived, he joined Butch
    Atwood to search the area west around the accident. They don't find Maura or even
    foot prints.\nSome of Maura's personal belongings were scattered inside, but her
    cell phone, credit cards, and backpack are all gone. Inside the card he finds
    an open \ncoke bottle filled with a red liquid that smelled of alcohol. \n  \n\
    \n\n        \nName: John Monaghan\nBackground: Police officer who responded to
    the scene.\nThis is the information that John Monaghan has and will provide only
    if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nOn the night of the disappearance,
    he got a call that Butch was reporting a car accident. He confined his search
    area to the area\nwhere there were stores and people and searched while driving
    around, staying in his car. He put together a general service report\nto note
    that he was assisting another department with the search. Later, he pulled the
    surveillance tapes from three locations that\nhad surveillance to see if Maura
    Murray was on them. He didn't find anything.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Chief Jeff
    Williams\nBackground: Police Chief of Haverhill, New Hampshire..\nThis is the
    information that Chief Jeff Williams has and will provide only if asked a question
    that would reveal it:\n\nIt has been claimed that he was the driver of the 001
    police SUV, which he denies, corroborating with\nCecil Smith that he is the driver.
    He also maintains that he was never at the scene.\nSeparately and after the Murray
    incident, the Chief was arrested and charged for driving while intoxicated and
    disobeying orders.\nWhile getting pulled over for speeding, he drunkenly tried
    to get away by driving even faster while his own officers pursued him.\n\n\n\n\

    she emailed her boyfriend: \"I love you more stud. I got your messages, \nbut
    honestly, I didn't feel like talking too much of anyone, I promise to call today

    her family had vacationed in the past. Telephone records indicate \nthe call lasted
    three minutes. At 1:13 pm, Murray called a fellow nursing student for reasons

    work supervisor of the nursing school faculty that she would be out of town for
    a week due to a death in her family.\nShe sent a similar email to her professor
    at the University of Massachusettes at the same time and after sending in her
    homework early.\nMurray used her personal computer to search MapQuest for directions
    to the Berkshires and Burlington, Vermont.\nAt 2:05 pm, Murray called a number
    which provides recorded information about booking hotels in Stowe, Vermont. The
    call lasted approximately five minutes. \nAt 2:18 pm, she telephoned her boyfriend
    and left a voice message promising him they would talk later. This call ended
    after one minute.\nAt 3:15 PM, there is security camera footage of Maura visiting
    a local ATM withdrawing $280 which is nearly all of the money she has in the account.\n
    The footage shows she's alone when she arrives and leaves.\nShortly after, there
    is footage at a nearby liquor store where she purchases $40 of alcohol including
    Baileys Irish Cream, Kahlúa, vodka, and a box of Franzia wine. She also appears

    Butch Atwood was driving a school bus when he saw Maura Murray's car crashed into
    a snowbank. He lives just 100 yards away from the scene.\nHe pulled over and asked

    assistance.\nHe knew that was a lie because there was no cell service in that
    area. He offered to call the police for her but she said no.\nHe went home and
    called the police anyway. while he didn't have eyes on Maura or tue car while
    he called, he did notice several cars pass by. Butch claims she didn't look intoxicated

    This is the information that Faith Westman has and will provide only if asked
    a question that would reveal it:\n\nFaith Westman was at home when Maura Murray's
    car crashed into a snowbank. Her house was the closest to the accident. She heard
    a loud \nthud and saw a single-car accident.\nFrom her point of view, it looked
    like a car had gone over the curb on a hairpin turn and crashed into a snowbank.\n
    She told police she saw a man in the vehicle smoking a cigarette.\n  \n\n\n  \
    \      \nName: Karen McNamara\nBackground: Neighbor who saw a car parked in front
    of Maura's.\nThis is the information that Karen McNamara has and will provide
    only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nShe left the office that night
    around 10 past 7 and arrived at the scene around 7:37 pm.\nWhen she passed by
    the Saturn on the side of the road, it was facing the opposite direction and there
    was a police SUV with\nthe number '001' on the side of it. It was parked\nnose-to-nose
    with the Saturn. She didn't see any people at all. Her cell phone didn't have
    reception in the area and it didn't look like an accident to her\nso she carried
    on. When she later reached Beaver pond, she made a personal call which Mike can
    corroborate with phone records.\nMike can also use this information to show that
    her arrival was several minutes before the police arrived. Faith doesn't totally
    trust\nthe police. She also got a call from the police department later and says
    it was weird that they were asking specifically if she\nwas sure that it was 001
    that she saw on the police car, not asking anything about Maura Murray\n  \n\n\
    \n        \nName: Cecil Smith\nBackground: Police officer who responded to the
    scene.\nThis is the information that Cecil Smith has and will provide only if
    asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nOfficial reports say Cecil Smith was
    the first officer to arrive on the scene of Maura's car. He was driving a 4x4
    explorer and \nwas dispatched to the report of a car accident.\nWhen he arrived,
    he observed a black Saturn facing the wrong direction but no one was in or around
    the car. He saw there was\nsomething red splashed on the window and the seat of
    the vehicle. It looked like wine. He approached Butch Atwood about what he saw\n
    and he said Maura didn't appear hurt or intoxicated and that Maura told Butch
    he didn't need to call 911 and that she claimed she\nalready called AAA. He said
    he actually didn't talk to Butch for very long. He claims he talked to Maura's
    dad Fred. In that communication\nFred allegedly told Officer Smith flippantly
    that Maura might have just gotten depressed and 'done the old squaw', and that
    sometimes when you're depressed you just\ngo off into the woods, you step off,
    and you die. This response shocked the officer. In another conversation with Maura's
    sister Kathleen,\nthe sister told the officer that Maura probably got in a big
    fight with her boyfriend Fred, went off into the woods, took a bunch of sleeping\n
    pills and died.\nLater when EMS arrived, he joined Butch Atwood to search the
    area west around the accident. They don't find Maura or even foot prints.\nSome
    of Maura's personal belongings were scattered inside, but her cell phone, credit
    cards, and backpack are all gone. Inside the card he finds an open \ncoke bottle
    filled with a red liquid that smelled of alcohol. \n  \n\n\n        \nName: John
    Monaghan\nBackground: Police officer who responded to the scene.\nThis is the
    information that John Monaghan has and will provide only if asked a question that
    would reveal it:\n\nOn the night of the disappearance, he got a call that Butch
    was reporting a car accident. He confined his search area to the area\nwhere there
    were stores and people and searched while driving around, staying in his car.
    He put together a general service report\nto note that he was assisting another
    department with the search. Later, he pulled the surveillance tapes from three
    locations that\nhad surveillance to see if Maura Murray was on them. He didn't
    find anything.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Chief Jeff Williams\nBackground: Police
    Chief of Haverhill, New Hampshire..\nThis is the information that Chief Jeff Williams
    has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nIt has
    been claimed that he was the driver of the 001 police SUV, which he denies, corroborating
    with\nCecil Smith that he is the driver. He also maintains that he was never at
    the scene.\nSeparately and after the Murray incident, the Chief was arrested and
    charged for driving while intoxicated and disobeying orders.\nWhile getting pulled
    over for speeding, he drunkenly tried to get away by driving even faster while
    his own officers pursued him.\n\n\n\n        \n\nRemember this information is
    only revealed by each person and only if the user asks the right questions.\n\n

    are seated in the living room.\n\n\nGenerate a dall-e image of middle-aged Fred
    murray seated in the living room with a 20-something work friend of Maura's.\n\
    \  \n\nLet the user know the following people are available for questioning:\n
    Anonymous Work Friend, Fred Murray, Billy Rausch\n\n\nName: Anonymous Work Friend\n
    Background: A friend of Maura's who also works shifts with her.\nThis is the information
    that Anonymous Work Friend has and will provide only if asked a question that
    would reveal it:\n\n    On the same weekend night when Maura dropped off Fred
    at the Quality Inn and borrowed his Toyota Corolla, Maura attended a dorm party\n\
    \    with friends in the evening. The friend doesn't know much about what happened
    at the party but they found it strange that later into the evening, \n    Maura
    said she needed to get the car back to her father. Now that they and Fred have
    exchanged these details, they both find it odd given\n    that it would have been
    fine if she came back the next day with the car. He wasn't expecting it that evening.
    She had also been drinking\n    so she could have sobered up over the evening.
    The friend feels like she had another reason for leaving such as leaving for or
    from something.\n\n    On another occasion prior to this on February 5, 2004,
    the friend and Maura were at work together. During the shift, Maura received a
    phone\n    call that made her so upset, she just stares out the window completely
    disengaged. Her supervisor was so worried for her, he ends her shift\n    early
    and walks her back to her dorm room. When the friend asks what's wrong, the only
    thing she says is \"my sister.\"\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Fred Murray\nBackground:
    Maura Murray's father.\nThis is the information that Fred Murray has and will
    provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nFred will agree with
    Cecil's account that Maura might have gone on a 'squaw walk' but says he just
    didn't know how to express himself and he\nwas very upset about Maura going missing.\n
    On a separate occasion when Maura wrecked his car, he claims he was upset but
    told her 'It's gonna be alright, it's not the worst thing in the world'\nHe 'knows'
    she wouldn't have committed suicide.\nHe says of Maura, \"if you'd met her, you'd
    love her. So quick to laugh. She's funny, really funny. She's the sweetest kid.\"\
    \nShe got all As in school. She was really determined. As a kid, she was very
    attentive, keeping a sharp eye on Julie. Kathleen was less in\nthe picture. Julie
    and Maura spent a lot of time with Fred. He knew he didn't have a lot of money
    to give them something big so they\nwould go camping, hiking, swimming in the
    rivers, especially in Bartlett New Hampshire. He doesn't know why she went wherever
    she was going that\nday but thinks about how close Bartlett was to where she disappeared,
    that maybe she was going there for some solace. He thinks someone\ngrabbed her
    and killed her. He wishes he could just have Maura to talk to her one last time.
    He wouldn't even have to say anything, neither of\nthem would.\n\n\n  The weekend
    before Maura went missing, Fred visited Maura at U Mass to go car shopping with
    her. He knew her 1996 Saturn was breaking down and was\n  desperately in need
    of a new one. They spent Saturday afternoon missing but didn't buy anything. In
    the evening, Fred offered to let Maura use his\n  car for the evening. She accepts,
    drops him off at a Quality inn where he's staying and heads back to campus.\n\
    \  Later that evening, Maura crashed the Toyota Corolla into a guard rail causing
    $10,000 of damage to the car. The police went to the scene\n  but there were no
    charges against Maura and a breathalizer was not administered. The police drove
    Maura back to the Quality Inn to stay\n  with her dad.\n  The following day, Fred
    finds out that insurance is going to cover the damage. However before filing the
    claim, he asks Maura to pick up\n  accident forms at the Registry of Motor Vehicles.
    Fred goes back home to Massachusettes and called her later at 11:30PM to remind
    her to get it\n  done. They make a plan to go over the forms the following night.
    This never happened because it's the night Maura disappeared.\n  Fred believes
    Maura was most likely headed to Bartlett, New Hampshire on the night of her disappearance.
    Growing up, the Murrays used to go\n  hiking frequently, as often as four times
    a week. She loved the white mountains.\n\n\n\n        \nName: Billy Rausch\nBackground:
    Boyfriend of Maura Murray.\nThis is the information that Billy Rausch has and
    will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n    Billy met Maura
    at Westpoint Military Academy in upstate NY during Maura's sophomore year and
    transferred to U Mass shortly after to study Nursing.\n    At this point, they
    were dating long distance through the point of her disappearance. Maura planned
    on spending time in Oklahoma where he was stationed.\n    Billy will describe
    their relationship as \"engaged to be engaged\".\n    Billy says he received a
    voicemail from Maura the day after Maura disappeared, Billy turned off his cellphone
    as he boarded a plane\n    to assist in the search efforts. Shortly after he did,
    he received a voicemail from an unknown number. It was short and wordless. He
    says\n    He could only hear crying and at the end a whimper. He swears this was
    Maura. Officials traced the number to an AT&T calling card. He remembers\n   \
    \ this well because Billy's mother Sharon gave Maura two AT&T calling cards a
    couple months earlier. Haverhill police claimed they traced the call\n    back
    to the American Red cross. Yet Sharon says multiple private investigators had
    tried and failed to trace the call.\n    Billy is also aware of the claim of a
    letter left in Maura's dorm room addressed to him. However he says he was with
    the officers when the dorm\n    room was being searched and there was no letter.

    Murray\nBackground: Maura Murray's second oldest sister.\nThis is the information
    that Julie Murray has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal
    it:\n\n    Julie attended West Point at the same time as Maura and ran track together
    and were incredibly close.\n    Julie and Billy weren't close but they shared
    some friends. Julie caught wind of a rumor that Billy might be cheating on Maura.\n\
    \    She confronted Maura about it, expressing her concerns as a big sister and
    suggested it was time for Maura to move on. She will say\n    Maura and Billy
    got into fights fairly frequently. When they did, Maura needed to be comforted
    and talked down afterwards.\n    Julie and Maura were 2 and a half years apart.
    They spent their youth running track together always wanting to make their father
    proud.\n    She describes her time at West Point is just being stressed every
    day. Talent doesn't matter in whether you'll make it through the first\n    six
    months. Julie and Maura would gossip and talk a lot, especially about Billy. Julie
    describes Bill as a talker saying\n    \"he was a little much for me.\" Julie
    and Maura's last conversation was about spring break. Maura was excited about
    it and was talking\n    about going to Myrtle beach. This was two days before
    her disappearance and she says there was nothing odd about her at the time. Maura\n\
    \    mentioned nothing about the trip she took when she disappeared. Julie defends
    her father. She says all over the internet people misrepresent\n    her dad. She
    thinks something bad happened. Maybe Maura's initial plan was to go up there for
    whatever reason no one knows, but something\n    happened and derailed that plan.
    If she was able to reach out and let them know she was fine, she would have but
    didn't. Julie thinks the FBI should\n    have been brought in from the beginning.
    There were changes to the police report, it took a long time for the reports to
    be published. The\n    police has never reached out to Julie to this day. She
    says if they had reached out to her sooner, maybe there was something she could

    Haverhill, New Hampshire. Morning at the scene of a black 1996 Saturn sedan up
    against the snowbank along Route 112, also known as Wild Ammonoosuc Road. \nThe

    who saw Maura Murray.\nThis is the information that Butch Atwood has and will
    provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nButch Atwood was driving
    a school bus when he saw Maura Murray's car crashed into a snowbank. He lives
    just 100 yards away from the scene.\nHe pulled over and asked her if she needed
    help. She said no and that she already called AAA for roadside assistance.\nHe
    knew that was a lie because there was no cell service in that area. He offered
    to call the police for her but she said no.\nHe went home and called the police
    anyway. while he didn't have eyes on Maura or tue car while he called, he did
    notice several cars pass by. Butch claims she didn't look intoxicated nor injured
    but was cold and shivering. You can share [this link](https://youtu.be/OfrIJQ5xgJE)
    to an interview with Atwood\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Faith Westman\nBackground:
    Neighbor who saw Maura Murray.\nThis is the information that Faith Westman has
    and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nFaith Westman
    was at home when Maura Murray's car crashed into a snowbank. Her house was the
    closest to the accident. She heard a loud \nthud and saw a single-car accident.\n
    From her point of view, it looked like a car had gone over the curb on a hairpin
    turn and crashed into a snowbank.\nShe told police she saw a man in the vehicle
    smoking a cigarette.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Cecil Smith\nBackground: Police
    officer who responded to the scene.\nThis is the information that Cecil Smith
    has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nOfficial
    reports say Cecil Smith was the first officer to arrive on the scene of Maura's
    car. He was driving a 4x4 explorer and \nwas dispatched to the report of a car
    accident.\nWhen he arrived, he observed a black Saturn facing the wrong direction
    but no one was in or around the car. He saw there was\nsomething red splashed
    on the window and the seat of the vehicle. It looked like wine. He approached
    Butch Atwood about what he saw\nand he said Maura didn't appear hurt or intoxicated
    and that Maura told Butch he didn't need to call 911 and that she claimed she\n
    already called AAA. He said he actually didn't talk to Butch for very long. He
    claims he talked to Maura's dad Fred. In that communication\nFred allegedly told
    Officer Smith flippantly that Maura might have just gotten depressed and 'done
    the old squaw', and that sometimes when you're depressed you just\ngo off into
    the woods, you step off, and you die. This response shocked the officer. In another
    conversation with Maura's sister Kathleen,\nthe sister told the officer that Maura
    probably got in a big fight with her boyfriend Fred, went off into the woods,
    took a bunch of sleeping\npills and died.\nLater when EMS arrived, he joined Butch
    Atwood to search the area west around the accident. They don't find Maura or even
    foot prints.\nSome of Maura's personal belongings were scattered inside, but her
    cell phone, credit cards, and backpack are all gone. Inside the card he finds
    an open \ncoke bottle filled with a red liquid that smelled of alcohol. \n  \n\
    \n\n        \nName: John Monaghan\nBackground: Police officer who responded to
    the scene.\nThis is the information that John Monaghan has and will provide only
    if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nOn the night of the disappearance,
    he got a call that Butch was reporting a car accident. He confined his search
    area to the area\nwhere there were stores and people and searched while driving
    around, staying in his car. He put together a general service report\nto note
    that he was assisting another department with the search. Later, he pulled the
    surveillance tapes from three locations that\nhad surveillance to see if Maura
    Murray was on them. He didn't find anything.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Chief Jeff
    Williams\nBackground: Police Chief of Haverhill, New Hampshire..\nThis is the
    information that Chief Jeff Williams has and will provide only if asked a question
    that would reveal it:\n\nIt has been claimed that he was the driver of the 001
    police SUV, which he denies, corroborating with\nCecil Smith that he is the driver.
    He also maintains that he was never at the scene.\nSeparately and after the Murray
    incident, the Chief was arrested and charged for driving while intoxicated and
    disobeying orders.\nWhile getting pulled over for speeding, he drunkenly tried
    to get away by driving even faster while his own officers pursued him.\n\n\n\n\

    honestly, I didn't feel like talking too much of anyone, I promise to call today

    a week due to a death in her family.\nShe sent a similar email to her professor
    at the University of Massachusettes at the same time and after sending in her
    homework early.\nMurray used her personal computer to search MapQuest for directions
    to the Berkshires and Burlington, Vermont.\nAt 2:05 pm, Murray called a number
    which provides recorded information about booking hotels in Stowe, Vermont. The
    call lasted approximately five minutes. \nAt 2:18 pm, she telephoned her boyfriend
    and left a voice message promising him they would talk later. This call ended
    after one minute.\nAt 3:15 PM, there is security camera footage of Maura visiting
    a local ATM withdrawing $280 which is nearly all of the money she has in the account.\n

    of state and had not received the call. Then Maura's other sister Kathleen called

    east of the accident where it\n    abruptly stopped. By nightfall, no other significant
    evidence was found in a 2 mile radius.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Butch Atwood\n
    Background: Bus driver who saw Maura Murray.\nThis is the information that Butch
    Atwood has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n
    Butch Atwood was driving a school bus when he saw Maura Murray's car crashed into
    a snowbank. He lives just 100 yards away from the scene.\nHe pulled over and asked
    her if she needed help. She said no and that she already called AAA for roadside
    assistance.\nHe knew that was a lie because there was no cell service in that
    area. He offered to call the police for her but she said no.\nHe went home and
    called the police anyway. while he didn't have eyes on Maura or tue car while
    he called, he did notice several cars pass by. Butch claims she didn't look intoxicated
    nor injured but was cold and shivering. You can share [this link](https://youtu.be/OfrIJQ5xgJE)
    to an interview with Atwood\n  \n\n\n        \nName: John Marotte\nBackground:
    Neighbor who saw activity around Maura's car.\nThis is the information that John
    Marotte has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n
    With his wife Virginia, John saw someone walking around Maura's car and spending
    some time near the trunk. Other than that, they didn't\nwitness anything else.\n\
    \  \n\n\n        \nName: Faith Westman\nBackground: Neighbor who saw Maura Murray.\n
    This is the information that Faith Westman has and will provide only if asked
    a question that would reveal it:\n\nFaith Westman was at home when Maura Murray's
    car crashed into a snowbank. Her house was the closest to the accident. She heard
    a loud \nthud and saw a single-car accident.\nFrom her point of view, it looked
    like a car had gone over the curb on a hairpin turn and crashed into a snowbank.\n
    She told police she saw a man in the vehicle smoking a cigarette.\n  \n\n\n  \
    \      \nName: Karen McNamara\nBackground: Neighbor who saw a car parked in front
    of Maura's.\nThis is the information that Karen McNamara has and will provide
    only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nShe left the office that night
    around 10 past 7 and arrived at the scene around 7:37 pm.\nWhen she passed by
    the Saturn on the side of the road, it was facing the opposite direction and there
    was a police SUV with\nthe number '001' on the side of it. It was parked\nnose-to-nose
    with the Saturn. She didn't see any people at all. Her cell phone didn't have
    reception in the area and it didn't look like an accident to her\nso she carried
    on. When she later reached Beaver pond, she made a personal call which Mike can
    corroborate with phone records.\nMike can also use this information to show that
    her arrival was several minutes before the police arrived. Faith doesn't totally
    trust\nthe police. She also got a call from the police department later and says
    it was weird that they were asking specifically if she\nwas sure that it was 001
    that she saw on the police car, not asking anything about Maura Murray\n  \n\n\
    \n        \nName: Cecil Smith\nBackground: Police officer who responded to the
    scene.\nThis is the information that Cecil Smith has and will provide only if
    asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nOfficial reports say Cecil Smith was
    the first officer to arrive on the scene of Maura's car. He was driving a 4x4
    explorer and \nwas dispatched to the report of a car accident.\nWhen he arrived,
    he observed a black Saturn facing the wrong direction but no one was in or around
    the car. He saw there was\nsomething red splashed on the window and the seat of
    the vehicle. It looked like wine. He approached Butch Atwood about what he saw\n
    and he said Maura didn't appear hurt or intoxicated and that Maura told Butch
    he didn't need to call 911 and that she claimed she\nalready called AAA. He said
    he actually didn't talk to Butch for very long. He claims he talked to Maura's
    dad Fred. In that communication\nFred allegedly told Officer Smith flippantly
    that Maura might have just gotten depressed and 'done the old squaw', and that
    sometimes when you're depressed you just\ngo off into the woods, you step off,
    and you die. This response shocked the officer. In another conversation with Maura's
    sister Kathleen,\nthe sister told the officer that Maura probably got in a big
    fight with her boyfriend Fred, went off into the woods, took a bunch of sleeping\n
    pills and died.\nLater when EMS arrived, he joined Butch Atwood to search the
    area west around the accident. They don't find Maura or even foot prints.\nSome
    of Maura's personal belongings were scattered inside, but her cell phone, credit
    cards, and backpack are all gone. Inside the card he finds an open \ncoke bottle
    filled with a red liquid that smelled of alcohol. \n  \n\n\n        \nName: John
    Monaghan\nBackground: Police officer who responded to the scene.\nThis is the
    information that John Monaghan has and will provide only if asked a question that
    would reveal it:\n\nOn the night of the disappearance, he got a call that Butch
    was reporting a car accident. He confined his search area to the area\nwhere there
    were stores and people and searched while driving around, staying in his car.
    He put together a general service report\nto note that he was assisting another
    department with the search. Later, he pulled the surveillance tapes from three
    locations that\nhad surveillance to see if Maura Murray was on them. He didn't
    find anything.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Chief Jeff Williams\nBackground: Police
    Chief of Haverhill, New Hampshire..\nThis is the information that Chief Jeff Williams
    has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nIt has
    been claimed that he was the driver of the 001 police SUV, which he denies, corroborating
    with\nCecil Smith that he is the driver. He also maintains that he was never at
    the scene.\nSeparately and after the Murray incident, the Chief was arrested and
    charged for driving while intoxicated and disobeying orders.\nWhile getting pulled
    over for speeding, he drunkenly tried to get away by driving even faster while
    his own officers pursued him.\n\n\n\n        \n\nRemember this information is

    fine if she came back the next day with the car. He wasn't expecting it that evening.
    She had also been drinking\n    so she could have sobered up over the evening.
    The friend feels like she had another reason for leaving such as leaving for or
    from something.\n\n    On another occasion prior to this on February 5, 2004,
    the friend and Maura were at work together. During the shift, Maura received a
    phone\n    call that made her so upset, she just stares out the window completely
    disengaged. Her supervisor was so worried for her, he ends her shift\n    early
    and walks her back to her dorm room. When the friend asks what's wrong, the only
    thing she says is \"my sister.\"\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Fred Murray\nBackground:
    Maura Murray's father.\nThis is the information that Fred Murray has and will
    provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nFred will agree with
    Cecil's account that Maura might have gone on a 'squaw walk' but says he just
    didn't know how to express himself and he\nwas very upset about Maura going missing.\n
    On a separate occasion when Maura wrecked his car, he claims he was upset but
    told her 'It's gonna be alright, it's not the worst thing in the world'\nHe 'knows'
    she wouldn't have committed suicide.\nHe says of Maura, \"if you'd met her, you'd
    love her. So quick to laugh. She's funny, really funny. She's the sweetest kid.\"\
    \nShe got all As in school. She was really determined. As a kid, she was very
    attentive, keeping a sharp eye on Julie. Kathleen was less in\nthe picture. Julie
    and Maura spent a lot of time with Fred. He knew he didn't have a lot of money
    to give them something big so they\nwould go camping, hiking, swimming in the
    rivers, especially in Bartlett New Hampshire. He doesn't know why she went wherever
    she was going that\nday but thinks about how close Bartlett was to where she disappeared,
    that maybe she was going there for some solace. He thinks someone\ngrabbed her
    and killed her. He wishes he could just have Maura to talk to her one last time.
    He wouldn't even have to say anything, neither of\nthem would.\n\n\n  The weekend
    before Maura went missing, Fred visited Maura at U Mass to go car shopping with
    her. He knew her 1996 Saturn was breaking down and was\n  desperately in need
    of a new one. They spent Saturday afternoon missing but didn't buy anything. In
    the evening, Fred offered to let Maura use his\n  car for the evening. She accepts,
    drops him off at a Quality inn where he's staying and heads back to campus.\n\
    \  Later that evening, Maura crashed the Toyota Corolla into a guard rail causing
    $10,000 of damage to the car. The police went to the scene\n  but there were no
    charges against Maura and a breathalizer was not administered. The police drove
    Maura back to the Quality Inn to stay\n  with her dad.\n  The following day, Fred
    finds out that insurance is going to cover the damage. However before filing the
    claim, he asks Maura to pick up\n  accident forms at the Registry of Motor Vehicles.
    Fred goes back home to Massachusettes and called her later at 11:30PM to remind
    her to get it\n  done. They make a plan to go over the forms the following night.
    This never happened because it's the night Maura disappeared.\n  Fred believes
    Maura was most likely headed to Bartlett, New Hampshire on the night of her disappearance.
    Growing up, the Murrays used to go\n  hiking frequently, as often as four times
    a week. She loved the white mountains.\n\n\n\n        \nName: Billy Rausch\nBackground:
    Boyfriend of Maura Murray.\nThis is the information that Billy Rausch has and
    will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n    Billy met Maura
    at Westpoint Military Academy in upstate NY during Maura's sophomore year and
    transferred to U Mass shortly after to study Nursing.\n    At this point, they
    were dating long distance through the point of her disappearance. Maura planned
    on spending time in Oklahoma where he was stationed.\n    Billy will describe
    their relationship as \"engaged to be engaged\".\n    Billy says he received a
    voicemail from Maura the day after Maura disappeared, Billy turned off his cellphone
    as he boarded a plane\n    to assist in the search efforts. Shortly after he did,
    he received a voicemail from an unknown number. It was short and wordless. He
    says\n    He could only hear crying and at the end a whimper. He swears this was
    Maura. Officials traced the number to an AT&T calling card. He remembers\n   \
    \ this well because Billy's mother Sharon gave Maura two AT&T calling cards a
    couple months earlier. Haverhill police claimed they traced the call\n    back
    to the American Red cross. Yet Sharon says multiple private investigators had
    tried and failed to trace the call.\n    Billy is also aware of the claim of a
    letter left in Maura's dorm room addressed to him. However he says he was with
    the officers when the dorm\n    room was being searched and there was no letter.
    It's not clear where this information came from.\n  \n\n\n        \n\nRemember

    Murray\nBackground: Maura Murray's second oldest sister.\nThis is the information
    that Julie Murray has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal
    it:\n\n    Julie attended West Point at the same time as Maura and ran track together
    and were incredibly close.\n    Julie and Billy weren't close but they shared
    some friends. Julie caught wind of a rumor that Billy might be cheating on Maura.\n\
    \    She confronted Maura about it, expressing her concerns as a big sister and
    suggested it was time for Maura to move on. She will say\n    Maura and Billy
    got into fights fairly frequently. When they did, Maura needed to be comforted
    and talked down afterwards.\n    Julie and Maura were 2 and a half years apart.
    They spent their youth running track together always wanting to make their father
    proud.\n    She describes her time at West Point is just being stressed every
    day. Talent doesn't matter in whether you'll make it through the first\n    six
    months. Julie and Maura would gossip and talk a lot, especially about Billy. Julie
    describes Bill as a talker saying\n    \"he was a little much for me.\" Julie
    and Maura's last conversation was about spring break. Maura was excited about
    it and was talking\n    about going to Myrtle beach. This was two days before
    her disappearance and she says there was nothing odd about her at the time. Maura\n\
    \    mentioned nothing about the trip she took when she disappeared. Julie defends
    her father. She says all over the internet people misrepresent\n    her dad. She
    thinks something bad happened. Maybe Maura's initial plan was to go up there for
    whatever reason no one knows, but something\n    happened and derailed that plan.
    If she was able to reach out and let them know she was fine, she would have but
    didn't. Julie thinks the FBI should\n    have been brought in from the beginning.
    There were changes to the police report, it took a long time for the reports to
    be published. The\n    police has never reached out to Julie to this day. She

    and backpack\n    were all gone.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Billy Rausch\nBackground:
    Boyfriend of Maura Murray.\nThis is the information that Billy Rausch has and
    will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n    Billy met Maura
    at Westpoint Military Academy in upstate NY during Maura's sophomore year and
    transferred to U Mass shortly after to study Nursing.\n    At this point, they
    were dating long distance through the point of her disappearance. Maura planned
    on spending time in Oklahoma where he was stationed.\n    Billy will describe
    their relationship as \"engaged to be engaged\".\n    Billy says he received a
    voicemail from Maura the day after Maura disappeared, Billy turned off his cellphone
    as he boarded a plane\n    to assist in the search efforts. Shortly after he did,
    he received a voicemail from an unknown number. It was short and wordless. He
    says\n    He could only hear crying and at the end a whimper. He swears this was
    Maura. Officials traced the number to an AT&T calling card. He remembers\n   \
    \ this well because Billy's mother Sharon gave Maura two AT&T calling cards a
    couple months earlier. Haverhill police claimed they traced the call\n    back
    to the American Red cross. Yet Sharon says multiple private investigators had
    tried and failed to trace the call.\n    Billy is also aware of the claim of a
    letter left in Maura's dorm room addressed to him. However he says he was with
    the officers when the dorm\n    room was being searched and there was no letter.
    It's not clear where this information came from.\n  \n\n\n        \n\nRemember
    this information is only revealed by each person and only if the user asks the
    right questions.\n\nLastly, add this to your message at the bottom:\n_🗺️ Map has

    a red stain on it.\n  \n\nLet the user know the following people are available

    Background: Maura Murray's father.\nThis is the information that Fred Murray has
    and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nFred will agree
    with Cecil's account that Maura might have gone on a 'squaw walk' but says he
    just didn't know how to express himself and he\nwas very upset about Maura going
    missing.\nOn a separate occasion when Maura wrecked his car, he claims he was
    upset but told her 'It's gonna be alright, it's not the worst thing in the world'\n
    He 'knows' she wouldn't have committed suicide.\nHe says of Maura, \"if you'd
    met her, you'd love her. So quick to laugh. She's funny, really funny. She's the
    sweetest kid.\"\nShe got all As in school. She was really determined. As a kid,
    she was very attentive, keeping a sharp eye on Julie. Kathleen was less in\nthe
    picture. Julie and Maura spent a lot of time with Fred. He knew he didn't have
    a lot of money to give them something big so they\nwould go camping, hiking, swimming
    in the rivers, especially in Bartlett New Hampshire. He doesn't know why she went
    wherever she was going that\nday but thinks about how close Bartlett was to where
    she disappeared, that maybe she was going there for some solace. He thinks someone\n
    grabbed her and killed her. He wishes he could just have Maura to talk to her
    one last time. He wouldn't even have to say anything, neither of\nthem would.\n\
    \n\n  In late 2004, a stranger approached Fred with a rusted and reddish-brown
    stained knife and tells him \"I think my brother might have killed your daughter.\"\
    \n  The stranger's brother lived in an A-Frame house less than a mile from the
    crash. After that night, he remembered his brother acting\n  really strange. Later
    he found a bloody knife in the glove compartment of his brother's car. Fred mails
    the knife to New Hampshire police along\n  with a note explaining everything.
    Fred gets a confirmation letter days later confirming they've received the package.
    Fred never heard\n  anything else about it or learned of any other lab results.
    He also found out that a backpack possibly belonging to Maura was found in the
    woods\n  but didn't know anything else about it. Officials on the case have only
    responded, \"we are aware of the backpack.\"\n\n\n\n        \nName: Julie Murray\n
    Background: Maura Murray's second oldest sister.\nThis is the information that
    Julie Murray has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\
    \n    Julie attended West Point at the same time as Maura and ran track together
    and were incredibly close.\n    Julie and Billy weren't close but they shared
    some friends. Julie caught wind of a rumor that Billy might be cheating on Maura.\n\
    \    She confronted Maura about it, expressing her concerns as a big sister and
    suggested it was time for Maura to move on. She will say\n    Maura and Billy
    got into fights fairly frequently. When they did, Maura needed to be comforted
    and talked down afterwards.\n    Julie and Maura were 2 and a half years apart.
    They spent their youth running track together always wanting to make their father
    proud.\n    She describes her time at West Point is just being stressed every
    day. Talent doesn't matter in whether you'll make it through the first\n    six
    months. Julie and Maura would gossip and talk a lot, especially about Billy. Julie
    describes Bill as a talker saying\n    \"he was a little much for me.\" Julie
    and Maura's last conversation was about spring break. Maura was excited about
    it and was talking\n    about going to Myrtle beach. This was two days before
    her disappearance and she says there was nothing odd about her at the time. Maura\n\
    \    mentioned nothing about the trip she took when she disappeared. Julie defends
    her father. She says all over the internet people misrepresent\n    her dad. She
    thinks something bad happened. Maybe Maura's initial plan was to go up there for
    whatever reason no one knows, but something\n    happened and derailed that plan.
    If she was able to reach out and let them know she was fine, she would have but
    didn't. Julie thinks the FBI should\n    have been brought in from the beginning.
    There were changes to the police report, it took a long time for the reports to
    be published. The\n    police has never reached out to Julie to this day. She
    says if they had reached out to her sooner, maybe there was something she could
    have remembered.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Kathleen Murray\nBackground: Maura Murray's
    oldest sister.\nThis is the information that Kathleen Murray has and will provide
    only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n    On February 5, 2004, Kathleen
    got out of rehab and her boyfriend celebrated by taking her to a liquor store.
    After relapsing mixing sleeping pills with alcohol,\n    Kathleen made a troubling
    call to Maura but is not able to divulge further details on what they discussed.

    He lives just 100 yards away from the scene.\nHe pulled over and asked her if
    she needed help. She said no and that she already called AAA for roadside assistance.\n
    He knew that was a lie because there was no cell service in that area. He offered
    to call the police for her but she said no.\nHe went home and called the police
    anyway. while he didn't have eyes on Maura or tue car while he called, he did
    notice several cars pass by. Butch claims she didn't look intoxicated nor injured

    car crashed into a snowbank. Her house was the closest to the accident. She heard
    a loud \nthud and saw a single-car accident.\nFrom her point of view, it looked
    like a car had gone over the curb on a hairpin turn and crashed into a snowbank.\n
    She told police she saw a man in the vehicle smoking a cigarette.\n  \n\n\n  \
    \      \nName: Karen McNamara\nBackground: Neighbor who saw a car parked in front
    of Maura's.\nThis is the information that Karen McNamara has and will provide
    only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nShe left the office that night
    around 10 past 7 and arrived at the scene around 7:37 pm.\nWhen she passed by
    the Saturn on the side of the road, it was facing the opposite direction and there
    was a police SUV with\nthe number '001' on the side of it. It was parked\nnose-to-nose
    with the Saturn. She didn't see any people at all. Her cell phone didn't have
    reception in the area and it didn't look like an accident to her\nso she carried
    on. When she later reached Beaver pond, she made a personal call which Mike can
    corroborate with phone records.\nMike can also use this information to show that
    her arrival was several minutes before the police arrived. Faith doesn't totally
    trust\nthe police. She also got a call from the police department later and says
    it was weird that they were asking specifically if she\nwas sure that it was 001
    that she saw on the police car, not asking anything about Maura Murray\n  \n\n\

    the area handing out flyers and checking with local motels. They used a leather
    glove belonging to Maura\n    to train the canine team to Maura's scent. The canines
    were able to trace Maura's scent up the road about 100 yards east of the accident
    where it\n    abruptly stopped. By nightfall, no other significant evidence was
    found in a 2 mile radius.\n  \n\n\n        \n\nRemember this information is only

    her family had vacationed in the past. Telephone records indicate \nthe call lasted
    three minutes. At 1:13 pm, Murray called a fellow nursing student for reasons
    unknown.\nOn the afternoon of Monday, February 9, at 1:24 pm, Murray emailed a
    work supervisor of the nursing school faculty that she would be out of town for
    a week due to a death in her family.\nShe sent a similar email to her professor
    at the University of Massachusettes at the same time and after sending in her

    to the Berkshires and Burlington, Vermont.\nAt 2:05 pm, Murray called a number
    which provides recorded information about booking hotels in Stowe, Vermont. The
    call lasted approximately five minutes. \nAt 2:18 pm, she telephoned her boyfriend

    The footage shows she's alone when she arrives and leaves.\nShortly after, there
    is footage at a nearby liquor store where she purchases $40 of alcohol including
    Baileys Irish Cream, Kahlúa, vodka, and a box of Franzia wine. She also appears

    Billy Rausch, Anonymous Work Friend\n\n\nName: Fred Murray\nBackground: Maura
    Murray's father.\nThis is the information that Fred Murray has and will provide
    only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\nFred will agree with Cecil's
    account that Maura might have gone on a 'squaw walk' but says he just didn't know
    how to express himself and he\nwas very upset about Maura going missing.\nOn a
    separate occasion when Maura wrecked his car, he claims he was upset but told
    her 'It's gonna be alright, it's not the worst thing in the world'\nHe 'knows'
    she wouldn't have committed suicide.\nHe says of Maura, \"if you'd met her, you'd
    love her. So quick to laugh. She's funny, really funny. She's the sweetest kid.\"\
    \nShe got all As in school. She was really determined. As a kid, she was very
    attentive, keeping a sharp eye on Julie. Kathleen was less in\nthe picture. Julie
    and Maura spent a lot of time with Fred. He knew he didn't have a lot of money
    to give them something big so they\nwould go camping, hiking, swimming in the
    rivers, especially in Bartlett New Hampshire. He doesn't know why she went wherever
    she was going that\nday but thinks about how close Bartlett was to where she disappeared,
    that maybe she was going there for some solace. He thinks someone\ngrabbed her
    and killed her. He wishes he could just have Maura to talk to her one last time.
    He wouldn't even have to say anything, neither of\nthem would.\n\n\n\n       \
    \ \nName: Kathleen Murray\nBackground: Maura Murray's oldest sister.\nThis is
    the information that Kathleen Murray has and will provide only if asked a question
    that would reveal it:\n\n    On February 5, 2004, Kathleen got out of rehab and
    her boyfriend celebrated by taking her to a liquor store. After relapsing mixing
    sleeping pills with alcohol,\n    Kathleen made a troubling call to Maura but
    is not able to divulge further details on what they discussed. \n  \n\n\n    \
    \    \nName: Julie Murray\nBackground: Maura Murray's second oldest sister.\n
    This is the information that Julie Murray has and will provide only if asked a
    question that would reveal it:\n\n    Julie attended West Point at the same time
    as Maura and ran track together and were incredibly close.\n    Julie and Billy
    weren't close but they shared some friends. Julie caught wind of a rumor that
    Billy might be cheating on Maura.\n    She confronted Maura about it, expressing
    her concerns as a big sister and suggested it was time for Maura to move on. She
    will say\n    Maura and Billy got into fights fairly frequently. When they did,
    Maura needed to be comforted and talked down afterwards.\n    Julie and Maura
    were 2 and a half years apart. They spent their youth running track together always
    wanting to make their father proud.\n    She describes her time at West Point
    is just being stressed every day. Talent doesn't matter in whether you'll make
    it through the first\n    six months. Julie and Maura would gossip and talk a
    lot, especially about Billy. Julie describes Bill as a talker saying\n    \"he
    was a little much for me.\" Julie and Maura's last conversation was about spring
    break. Maura was excited about it and was talking\n    about going to Myrtle beach.
    This was two days before her disappearance and she says there was nothing odd
    about her at the time. Maura\n    mentioned nothing about the trip she took when
    she disappeared. Julie defends her father. She says all over the internet people
    misrepresent\n    her dad. She thinks something bad happened. Maybe Maura's initial
    plan was to go up there for whatever reason no one knows, but something\n    happened
    and derailed that plan. If she was able to reach out and let them know she was
    fine, she would have but didn't. Julie thinks the FBI should\n    have been brought
    in from the beginning. There were changes to the police report, it took a long
    time for the reports to be published. The\n    police has never reached out to
    Julie to this day. She says if they had reached out to her sooner, maybe there
    was something she could have remembered.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Billy Rausch\n
    Background: Boyfriend of Maura Murray.\nThis is the information that Billy Rausch
    has and will provide only if asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n    Billy
    met Maura at Westpoint Military Academy in upstate NY during Maura's sophomore
    year and transferred to U Mass shortly after to study Nursing.\n    At this point,
    they were dating long distance through the point of her disappearance. Maura planned
    on spending time in Oklahoma where he was stationed.\n    Billy will describe
    their relationship as \"engaged to be engaged\".\n    Billy says he received a
    voicemail from Maura the day after Maura disappeared, Billy turned off his cellphone
    as he boarded a plane\n    to assist in the search efforts. Shortly after he did,
    he received a voicemail from an unknown number. It was short and wordless. He
    says\n    He could only hear crying and at the end a whimper. He swears this was
    Maura. Officials traced the number to an AT&T calling card. He remembers\n   \
    \ this well because Billy's mother Sharon gave Maura two AT&T calling cards a
    couple months earlier. Haverhill police claimed they traced the call\n    back
    to the American Red cross. Yet Sharon says multiple private investigators had
    tried and failed to trace the call.\n    Billy is also aware of the claim of a
    letter left in Maura's dorm room addressed to him. However he says he was with
    the officers when the dorm\n    room was being searched and there was no letter.
    It's not clear where this information came from.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Anonymous
    Work Friend\nBackground: A friend of Maura's who also works shifts with her.\n
    This is the information that Anonymous Work Friend has and will provide only if
    asked a question that would reveal it:\n\n    On the same weekend night when Maura
    dropped off Fred at the Quality Inn and borrowed his Toyota Corolla, Maura attended
    a dorm party\n    with friends in the evening. The friend doesn't know much about
    what happened at the party but they found it strange that later into the evening,
    \n    Maura said she needed to get the car back to her father. Now that they and
    Fred have exchanged these details, they both find it odd given\n    that it would
    have been fine if she came back the next day with the car. He wasn't expecting
    it that evening. She had also been drinking\n    so she could have sobered up
    over the evening. The friend feels like she had another reason for leaving such
    as leaving for or from something.\n\n    On another occasion prior to this on
    February 5, 2004, the friend and Maura were at work together. During the shift,
    Maura received a phone\n    call that made her so upset, she just stares out the
    window completely disengaged. Her supervisor was so worried for her, he ends her
    shift\n    early and walks her back to her dorm room. When the friend asks what's
    wrong, the only thing she says is \"my sister.\"\n  \n\n\n        \n\nRemember

    it:\n\nOfficial reports say Cecil Smith was the first officer to arrive on the
    scene of Maura's car. He was driving a 4x4 explorer and \nwas dispatched to the
    report of a car accident.\nWhen he arrived, he observed a black Saturn facing
    the wrong direction but no one was in or around the car. He saw there was\nsomething
    red splashed on the window and the seat of the vehicle. It looked like wine. He
    approached Butch Atwood about what he saw\nand he said Maura didn't appear hurt
    or intoxicated and that Maura told Butch he didn't need to call 911 and that she
    claimed she\nalready called AAA. He said he actually didn't talk to Butch for
    very long. He claims he talked to Maura's dad Fred. In that communication\nFred
    allegedly told Officer Smith flippantly that Maura might have just gotten depressed
    and 'done the old squaw', and that sometimes when you're depressed you just\n
    go off into the woods, you step off, and you die. This response shocked the officer.
    In another conversation with Maura's sister Kathleen,\nthe sister told the officer
    that Maura probably got in a big fight with her boyfriend Fred, went off into
    the woods, took a bunch of sleeping\npills and died.\nLater when EMS arrived,
    he joined Butch Atwood to search the area west around the accident. They don't
    find Maura or even foot prints.\nSome of Maura's personal belongings were scattered
    inside, but her cell phone, credit cards, and backpack are all gone. Inside the
    card he finds an open \ncoke bottle filled with a red liquid that smelled of alcohol.

    he got a call that Butch was reporting a car accident. He confined his search
    area to the area\nwhere there were stores and people and searched while driving
    around, staying in his car. He put together a general service report\nto note
    that he was assisting another department with the search. Later, he pulled the
    surveillance tapes from three locations that\nhad surveillance to see if Maura
    Murray was on them. He didn't find anything.\n  \n\n\n        \nName: Chief Jeff
