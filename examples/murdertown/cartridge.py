Butch Atwood was driving a school bus when he saw Maura Murray's car crashed into a snowbank. He lives just 100 yards away from the scene.
He pulled over and asked her if she needed help. She said no and that she already called AAA for roadside assistance.
He knew that was a lie because there was no cell service in that area. He offered to call the police for her but she said no.
He went home and called the police anyway. while he didn't have eyes on Maura or tue car while he called, he did notice several cars pass by.

Faith Westman was at home when Maura Murray's car crashed into a snowbank. Her house was the closest to the accident. She heard a loud

She left the office that night around 10 past 7 and arrived at the scene around 7:37 pm.
When she passed by the Saturn on the side of the road, it was facing the opposite direction and there was a police SUV with
the number '001' on the side of it. It was parked
nose-to-nose with the Saturn. She didn't see any people at all. Her cell phone didn't have reception in the area and it didn't look like an accident to her
so she carried on. When she later reached Beaver pond, she made a personal call which Mike can corroborate with phone records.
Mike can also use this information to show that her arrival was several minutes before the police arrived. Faith doesn't totally trust
the police. She also got a call from the police department later and says it was weird that they were asking specifically if she
was sure that it was 001 that she saw on the police car, not asking anything about Maura Murray

Official reports say Cecil Smith was the first officer to arrive on the scene of Maura's car. He was driving a 4x4 explorer and 
was dispatched to the report of a car accident.
When he arrived, he observed a black Saturn facing the wrong direction but no one was in or around the car. He saw there was
something red splashed on the window and the seat of the vehicle. It looked like wine. He approached Butch Atwood about what he saw
and he said Maura didn't appear hurt or intoxicated and that Maura told Butch he didn't need to call 911 and that she claimed she
already called AAA. He said he actually didn't talk to Butch for very long. He claims he talked to Maura's dad Fred. In that communication
Fred allegedly told Officer Smith flippantly that Maura might have just gotten depressed and 'done the old squaw', and that sometimes when you're depressed you just
go off into the woods, you step off, and you die. This response shocked the officer. In another conversation with Maura's sister Kathleen,
the sister told the officer that Maura probably got in a big fight with her boyfriend Fred, went off into the woods, took a bunch of sleeping
pills and died.
Later when EMS arrived, he joined Butch Atwood to search the area west around the accident. They don't find Maura or even foot prints.
Inside the car, he finds an open coke bottle with red liquid in it. The liquid had a strong alcoholic odor. Some of Maura's personal belongings
were scattered inside, but her cell phone, credit cards, and backpack are all gone.

The analyst has gathered evidence from security camera footage and Maura's personal computer.
The first reported contact Murray had with anyone on February 9, the day of her disappearance, was at 1:00 pm, when she emailed her boyfriend: "I love you more stud. I got your messages, 
but honestly, I didn't feel like talking too much of anyone, I promise to call today though. Love you, Maura" She also made a phone call inquiring about 
renting a condominium at the same Bartlett, New Hampshire, condo association with which her family had vacationed in the past. Telephone records indicate 
the call lasted three minutes. At 1:13 pm, Murray called a fellow nursing student for reasons unknown.
On the afternoon of Monday, February 9, at 1:24 pm, Murray emailed a work supervisor of the nursing school faculty that she would be out of town for a week due to a death in her family.
She sent a similar email to her professor at the University of Massachusettes at the same time and after sending in her homework early.
Murray used her personal computer to search MapQuest for directions to the Berkshires and Burlington, Vermont.
At 2:05 pm, Murray called a number which provides recorded information about booking hotels in Stowe, Vermont. The call lasted approximately five minutes. 
At 2:18 pm, she telephoned her boyfriend and left a voice message promising him they would talk later. This call ended after one minute.
At 3:15 PM, there is security camera footage of Maura visiting a local ATM withdrawing $280 which is nearly all of the money she has in the account.
The footage shows she's alone when she arrives and leaves.
Shortly after, there is footage at a nearby liquor store where she purchases $40 of alcohol including Baileys Irish Cream, Kahl√∫a, vodka, and a box of Franzia wine. She also appears alone.
She called to check her voicemail at 4:37 pm, the last recorded use of her cell phone.
